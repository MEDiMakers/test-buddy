According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions. \\nSurvival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs).

Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed. \\nBlood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed. \\nBlood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed. \\nAdopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. \\n\\n1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK?\\nA heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack. \\n\\nFigure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery:\\ndescription:\\nThis figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B.\\nSection A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked.\\nSection B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows:\\nHealthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.\\n\\nSymptoms of a Heart Attack \\nA person who has a heart attack may experience any of these: \\nPain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue. \\nShortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack. \\nOther Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness \\nIf a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest. \\nLearn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. \\n\\n1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST?\\nWhen a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases.\\nWhen VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally. \\nBiological death and Clinical death \\n\\nFigure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes \\ndescription:\\n0 minutes: Breathing stops. Heart will soon stop beating.\\n4-6 minutes: Brain damage possible.\\n6-10 minutes: Brain damage likely.\\nOver 10 minutes: Irreversible brain damage certain.\\n\\nWhen cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the \\n\\ncirculation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible.\\nAir contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain. \\nImmediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. \\n\\n1.6:  OTHER  COMMON  CAUSES  OF  CARDIAC ARREST\\nA heart attack is the most common cause of cardiac arrest. There are other causes, which include: \\nDrug overdose, Choking, Smoke inhalation, Severe Trauma, Drowning, Electrocution, Severe allergy, Stroke\\nDeath in these situations can be prevented if someone trained in CPR and first-aid skills provides prompt help. \\n\\n1.7: THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL\\nThe essential steps for helping a cardiac arrest victim are illustrated in a system called the “Chain of Survival”. The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early CPR, Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.\\n\\nFirst Ring: Prevention \\nPrevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles. \\n\\nSecond Ring: Early Activation and AED Access \\nCall for ambulance (dial 995) and get an AED if visible and near-by. Follow the SCDF dispatcher’s instructions. \\n\\nThird Ring: Early CPR \\nThe brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. CPR must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart. \\n\\nFourth Ring: Early Defibrillation \\nAutomated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate. \\n\\nFifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance) \\nQuick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival. \\n\\nSixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support\\nMedical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators). \\n\\nSeventh Ring: Recovery \\nTo ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy. \\n\\n1.8: SCDF MYRESPONDER MOBILE APPLICATION\\nIn Singapore, many of the emergency cases SCDF responds to could be quickly attended to by members of the public even before SCDF’s arrival. For example, more than 3000 people suffer from Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA), with a survival rate of just 5%, which could be improved by simple medical intervention within the first few critical minutes. At the same time, there are more than 1,000 minor fires (such as rubbish chute/bin fire) that could easily be extinguished using publicly-available means.

However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable). \\nDuring Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). \\nIn the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates.\\n\\nThe Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an AED by instructing others nearby “Get an AED”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty. \\nResearch has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.\\n\\n3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs):\\nAutomated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. AEDs are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following: \\n(a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart. \\n(b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked. \\n(c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level. \\n(d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached AED pads. \\n(e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). \\n(f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. \\n\\n3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an AED. Avoid the following: \\nMetallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer. \\nWater - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel. \\nGas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying AED.\\n\\nSteps in chest preparation and applying the AED electrode pads: \\n(1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of AED electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing. \\n(2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. AEDs come with a shaver blade to expedite this. \\n(3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall. \\n(4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices. \\n(5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement. \\n(6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of AED electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.\\n\\n\\n3.4: PLACEMENT OF Automated External Defibrillator (AED) ELECTRODE PADS: Placement of AED Pads:\\n\\nRight Pad: Place one pad on the right side of the chest, just below the right collar bone.\\nLeft Pad: Place the other pad just below and to the left of the left nipple.\\n\\nSteps for Applying AED Pads:\\n(1)Open the packet containing AED pads with cable and connector.\\n(2)Peel off the protective backing from the pads.\\n(3)Follow the pictures on the pads to determine their correct location on the chest.\\n(4)Press the pads firmly onto the chest wall.\\n(5)Stand clear when the AED is analyzing the heart rhythm.\\n(6)Stand clear when pressing the button to deliver the shock.\\n\\nKey Note:\\nMinimize Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) interruption when placing AED pads and during defibrillation.\\n\\nNA\\n\\n3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES \\n1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing. \\n2.

      "Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality. \n",
      "A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions. \n",

      "The heart is a muscular pump located in the center of the chest and slightly towards the left. \n",
      "The heart has two halves. The right side receives low oxygen blood from all parts of the body through veins and pumps it to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries to pick up oxygen.\n",
      "The left side receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins and delivers it to all parts of the body, including the vital organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The heart muscles receive oxygen rich blood via a set of coronary arteries. \n",
      "The pumping action of the heart is initiated by electrical signals from a pacemaker (sinoatrial or SA node), these signals travel to other parts of the heart in an orderly manner through a conductive network. The electrical signals from the heart can be picked up by an electrocardiogram (ECG).\n",
      "The pumping action gives rise to an organized heart-beat at regular rate of 60-100 beats per minute in a normal person. \n",
      "\n",
      "On an ECG, normal heart rhythm, also known as the Normal Sinus Rhythm, appears as below:\n",
      "5 large squares = 1second\n",
      "1 small square = 0.04 s \n",
      "1 large square = 0.2 s\n",

      "\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "21% of air consists of oxygen, of which 5% is extracted by the lungs. The extracted oxygen is passed to the blood within the capillaries of the lungs. The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart. \n",
      "Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs \n",
      "The remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK\n",
      "Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are: \n",
      "Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. \n",
      "\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This habit should be avoided altogether.\n",
      "Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed. \n",
      "Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed. \n",
      "Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed. \n",
      "Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK?\n",
      "A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack. \n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery:\n",
      "description:\n",
      "This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B.\n",
      "Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked.\n",
      "Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows:\n",
      "Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms of a Heart Attack \n",
      "A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these: \n",
      "Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue. \n",
      "Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack. \n",
      "Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness \n",
      "If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest. \n",
      "Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST?\n",
      "When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases.\n",
      "When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally. \n",

      "When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the \n",

      "circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible.\n",
      "Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain. \n",

      "First Ring: Prevention \n",
      "Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles. \n",

      "3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation:\n",
      "At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable). \n",
      "During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). \n",
      "In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an AED by instructing others nearby “Get an AED”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty. \n",
      "Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs):\n",
      "Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. AEDs are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following: \n",
      "(a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart. \n",
      "(b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked. \n",
      "(c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level. \n",
      "(d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached AED pads. \n",
      "(e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). \n",
      "(f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. \n",
      "\n",
      "3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an AED. Avoid the following: \n",
      "Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer. \n",
      "Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel. \n",
      "Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying AED.\n",
      "\n",
      "Steps in chest preparation and applying the AED electrode pads: \n",
      "(1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of AED electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing. \n",
      "(2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. AEDs come with a shaver blade to expedite this. \n",
      "(3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall. \n",
      "(4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices. \n",
      "(5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement. \n",
      "(6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of AED electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.\n",

      "\n",
      "3.4: PLACEMENT OF Automated External Defibrillator (AED) ELECTRODE PADS: Placement of AED Pads:\n",

      "Left Pad: Place the other pad just below and to the left of the left nipple.\n",

      "Steps for Applying AED Pads:\n",
      "(1)Open the packet containing AED pads with cable and connector.\n",
      "(2)Peel off the protective backing from the pads.\n",
      "(3)Follow the pictures on the pads to determine their correct location on the chest.\n",

      "6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing. \n",
      "7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing. \n",
