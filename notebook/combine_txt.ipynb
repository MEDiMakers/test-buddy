       "['3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation:\\nAt the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable). \\nDuring Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). \\nIn the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates.\\nThe Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty. \\nResearch has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.',\n",
       " '3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs):\\nAutomated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following: \\n(a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart. \\n(b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked. \\n(c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level. \\n(d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads. \\n(e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). \\n(f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ',\n",
       " '3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following: \\nMetallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer. \\nWater - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel. \\nGas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator.\\nSteps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads: \\n(1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing. \\n(2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this. \\n(3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall. \\n(4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices. \\n(5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement. \\n(6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.',\n",
       " '3.4: PLACEMENT OF Automated External Defibrillator (AED) ELECTRODE PADS: Placement of Automated External Defibrillator Pads:\\nRight Pad: Place one pad on the right side of the chest, just below the right collar bone.\\nLeft Pad: Place the other pad just below and to the left of the left nipple.\\nSteps for Applying Automated External Defibrillator Pads:\\n(1)Open the packet containing Automated External Defibrillator pads with cable and connector.\\n(2)Peel off the protective backing from the pads.\\n(3)Follow the pictures on the pads to determine their correct location on the chest.\\n(4)Press the pads firmly onto the chest wall.\\n(5)Stand clear when the Automated External Defibrillator is analyzing the heart rhythm.\\n(6)Stand clear when pressing the button to deliver the shock.\\nKey Note:\\nMinimize Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) interruption when placing Automated External Defibrillator pads and during defibrillation.',\n",
       " '3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES \\n1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing. \\n2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”. \\n3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase.\\n4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it. \\n5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” \\n6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing. \\n7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing. \\n8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives. \\n9. Throughout this period, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should remain connected to the casualty.',\n",
