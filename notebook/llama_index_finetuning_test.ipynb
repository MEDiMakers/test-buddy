       "['Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality. \\nA person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions. \\nSurvival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands. ',\n",
       " 'The heart is a muscular pump located in the center of the chest and slightly towards the left. \\nThe heart has two halves. The right side receives low oxygen blood from all parts of the body through veins and pumps it to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries to pick up oxygen.\\nThe left side receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins and delivers it to all parts of the body, including the vital organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and brain.',\n",
       " 'The heart muscles receive oxygen rich blood via a set of coronary arteries. \\nThe pumping action of the heart is initiated by electrical signals from a pacemaker (sinoatrial or SA node), these signals travel to other parts of the heart in an orderly manner through a conductive network. The electrical signals from the heart can be picked up by an electrocardiogram (ECG).\\nThe pumping action gives rise to an organized heart-beat at regular rate of 60-100 beats per minute in a normal person. ',\n",
       " 'On an electrocardiogram (ECG), normal heart rhythm, also known as the Normal Sinus Rhythm, appears as below:\\n5 large squares = 1second\\n1 small square = 0.04 s \\n1 large square = 0.2 s\\n1 QRS per second\\nHeart rate = 60 per minute\\nCount the number of large intervals and divide into 300 squares between 2 RR\\nThe human body has two lungs which absorb oxygen from the air that is breathed in. 21% of air consists of oxygen, of which 5% is extracted by the lungs. The extracted oxygen is passed to the blood within the capillaries of the lungs. The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart. \\nExchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs \\nThe remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life.

       " '1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK\\nSurvival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are: \\nSmoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether.\\nBlood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed. \\nBlood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed. \\nBlood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed. \\nAdopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ',\n",
       " '1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK?\\nA heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack. \\n\\nFigure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery:\\ndescription:\\nThis figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B.\\nSection A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked.\\nSection B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows:\\nHealthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.\\n\\nSymptoms of a Heart Attack \\nA person who has a heart attack may experience any of these: \\nPain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue. \\nShortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack. \\nOther Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness \\nIf a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest. \\nLearn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ',\n",
       " '1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST?\\nWhen a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases.\\nWhen VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally. \\nBiological death and Clinical death \\n\\nFigure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes \\ndescription:\\n0 minutes: Breathing stops. Heart will soon stop beating.\\n4-6 minutes: Brain damage possible.\\n6-10 minutes: Brain damage likely.\\nOver 10 minutes: Irreversible brain damage certain.',\n",
       " 'When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the \\ncirculation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible.\\nAir contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain. \\nImmediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival.

       " '1.6:  OTHER  COMMON  CAUSES  OF  CARDIAC ARREST\\nA heart attack is the most common cause of cardiac arrest. There are other causes, which include: \\nDrug overdose, Choking, Smoke inhalation, Severe Trauma, Drowning, Electrocution, Severe allergy, Stroke\\nDeath in these situations can be prevented if someone trained in CPR and first-aid skills provides prompt help. ',\n",
       " '1.7: THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL\\nThe essential steps for helping a cardiac arrest victim are illustrated in a system called the “Chain of Survival”. The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.\\n\\nFirst Ring: Prevention \\nPrevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles. \\n\\nSecond Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access \\nCall for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions. \\n\\nThird Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) \\nThe brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart. \\n\\nFourth Ring: Early Defibrillation \\nAutomated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate. \\n\\nFifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance) \\nQuick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival. \\nSixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support\\nMedical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators). \\n\\nSeventh Ring: Recovery \\nTo ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

For example, more than 3000 people suffer from Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA), with a survival rate of just 5%, which could be improved by simple medical intervention within the first few critical minutes. At the same time, there are more than 1,000 minor fires (such as rubbish chute/bin fire) that could easily be extinguished using publicly-available means.

       " '\\n\\n3.9: CHILD/INFANT DEFIBRILLATION\\nUse of Automated External Defibrillator (AED) in Children \\nOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest in children are usually from non-cardiac causes with majority of the casualties presenting with non-shockable cardiac rhythms (asystole or pulseless electrical activity). \\nThus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation. \\nHowever, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%. School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.',\n",
       " 'Recommendation for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Use in Children \\nThe International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) advocates early use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) on children to analyse rhythms and provide defibrillation in cases of cardiac arrest with shockable rhythms. When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose. If a paediatric dose-attenuating system is unavailable, then a standard Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be used.',\n",

       " '3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation:\\nAt the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable). \\nDuring Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). \\nIn the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates.\\nThe Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty. \\nResearch has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.',\n",
       " '3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs):\\nAutomated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following: \\n(a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart. \\n(b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked. \\n(c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level. \\n(d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads. \\n(e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). \\n(f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ',\n",
       " '3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following: \\nMetallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer. \\nWater - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel. \\nGas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator.\\nSteps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads: \\n(1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing. \\n(2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this. \\n(3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall. \\n(4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices. \\n(5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement. \\n(6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.',\n",

       " '3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES \\n1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing. \\n2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”. \\n3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase.\\n4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it. \\n5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” \\n6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing. \\n7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing. \\n8.

       " 'Step 4: Open the airway \\n- Perform the Head-Tilt, Chin-lift manoeuvre  to open the airway.  \\n- While maintaining head tilt, open the mouth gently to check for visible foreign  bodies.  \\n- If no foreign body is seen, perform another 30 chest compressions. \\n- If a foreign body  is seen, maintain the open airway with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre and insert the index finger of your other hand into the casualty’s mouth along the inside of the cheek. \\n- Use a hooking action to dislodge the foreign body and manoeuvre it out of the mouth. Take care not to force the foreign body deeper into the throat. This manoeuvre is known as the finger sweep . \\nNote:  \\n- Do not perform blind finger sweep. Blind finger sweep may push the object back or further into the airway.  \\n- However, if there are no objects found in the mouth, repeat steps 3 and 4 until object has been removed.  \\n- For lay rescuers – Once object has been removed, check for breathing. If breathing is absent, repeat steps 3 and 4 until breathing resumes or emergency help arrives.  For trained healthcare providers – See step 5. \\n\\nFor Trained Healthcare Providers:\\n \\nStep 5: Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation  \\n- Attempt one v entilation via BVM (1st ventilation). If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.   \\n- Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective. \\n- Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.  \\n- Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.   \\n- Release the nose after each breath.  \\n- If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.  \\n- If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).  \\n- Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.  \\n- Check for normal breathing and pulse.  \\n- If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR. \\n- If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.  \\n- If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.  \\n\\nNote:  \\n1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.  \\n2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you m ay take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions).

       " '6.1: INFANT CPR  \\n \\nThis module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.  \\nInfants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.  \\n\\n(D) Check for Danger  \\nEnsure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.  \\n \\n(R) Check for Responsiveness  \\n- The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’.\\n- Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.   \\n- Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.  \\n \\nFor CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.   \\n\\n(S) Shout to get help  \\nIf the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.  \\n- In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED. \\n \\n(A) Ask someone to get an AED \\n- Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty. \\n\\n(B) Check for normal Breathing  \\n- Look for the rise and fall of the chest \\n- Do not take more than 10 seconds.  \\n- It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping. \\n \\nFor trained healthcare providers only  \\n- Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.  \\n- Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing . \\n- Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.  \\n- If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.  \\n\\n \\n(C) Chest Compressions  \\n- Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:  \\n    - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line \\n    between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.  \\n\\n    - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next \\n    to your index finger on the center of \\n    the infant’s chest.  \\n    \\n    - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and \\n    ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest \\n    compressions  using the pulp of the fingers. \\n \\n    - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm). \\n    - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.  \\n    - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

Unless situated in sufficiently (re)ionised regions, Lyman-α emission from these galaxies would be strongly absorbed by neutral gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We conservatively estimate sizes of the ionised regions required to reconcile the relatively low Lyman-α velocity offsets (ΔvLyα<300kms−1) with moderately high Lyman-α escape fractions (fesc,Lyα>5%) observed in our sample of LAEs, indicating the presence of ionised ``bubbles'' with physical sizes of the order of 0.1pMpc≲Rion≲1pMpc in a patchy reionisation scenario where the bubbles are embedded in a fully neutral IGM. Around half of the LAEs in our sample are found to coincide with large-scale galaxy overdensities seen in FRESCO at z∼5.8-5.9 and z∼7.3, suggesting Lyman-α transmission is strongly enhanced in such overdense regions, and underlining the importance of LAEs as tracers of the first large-scale ionised bubbles. Considering only spectroscopically confirmed galaxies, we find our sample of UV-faint LAEs (MUV≳−20mag) and their direct neighbours are generally not able to produce the required ionised regions based on the Lyman-α transmission properties, suggesting lower-luminosity sources likely play an important role in carving out these bubbles. These observations demonstrate the combined power of JWST multi-object and slitless spectroscopy in acquiring a unique view of the early stages of Cosmic Reionisation via the most distant LAEs.\"\"\"\n",

Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[6] In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[7] The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.\"\"\"\n",

In this paper, we replace policy gradient with proximal policy optimization (PPO), which is a proved more efficient reinforcement learning algorithm, and propose a dynamic approach for PPO (PPO-dynamic). We demonstrate the efficacy of PPO and PPO-dynamic on conditional sequence generation tasks including synthetic experiment and chit-chat chatbot. The results show that PPO and PPO-dynamic can beat policy gradient by stability and performance.\"\"\"\n",

    "Document: \"\"\"Inside the bubble: exploring the environments of reionisation-era Lyman-α emitting galaxies with JADES and FRESCO: We present a study of the environments of 16 Lyman-α emitting galaxies (LAEs) in the reionisation era (5.8<z<8) identified by JWST/NIRSpec as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Unless situated in sufficiently (re)ionised regions, Lyman-α emission from these galaxies would be strongly absorbed by neutral gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We conservatively estimate sizes of the ionised regions required to reconcile the relatively low Lyman-α velocity offsets (ΔvLyα<300kms−1) with moderately high Lyman-α escape fractions (fesc,Lyα>5%) observed in our sample of LAEs, indicating the presence of ionised ``bubbles'' with physical sizes of the order of 0.1pMpc≲Rion≲1pMpc in a patchy reionisation scenario where the bubbles are embedded in a fully neutral IGM. Around half of the LAEs in our sample are found to coincide with large-scale galaxy overdensities seen in FRESCO at z∼5.8-5.9 and z∼7.3, suggesting Lyman-α transmission is strongly enhanced in such overdense regions, and underlining the importance of LAEs as tracers of the first large-scale ionised bubbles. Considering only spectroscopically confirmed galaxies, we find our sample of UV-faint LAEs (MUV≳−20mag) and their direct neighbours are generally not able to produce the required ionised regions based on the Lyman-α transmission properties, suggesting lower-luminosity sources likely play an important role in carving out these bubbles. These observations demonstrate the combined power of JWST multi-object and slitless spectroscopy in acquiring a unique view of the early stages of Cosmic Reionisation via the most distant LAEs.\"\"\"\n",
