[{'Question': 'What is the most common underlying cardiac rhythm at the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, and what is the treatment for this rhythm?',
  'Answer': 'The most common underlying cardiac rhythm at the time of a sudden cardiac arrest is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED), together with chest compressions.'},
 {'Question': 'What is the effect of delaying treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation on the survival rate of the patient?',
  'Answer': 'The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole.'},
 {'Question': 'What is the purpose of an Automated External Defibrillator (AED), and who can operate it?',
  'Answer': 'The purpose of an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is to analyze the casualtyâ€™s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed. An AED can be operated by a lay rescuer, as it is able to analyze the cardiac rhythm and advise if a shock is needed.'},
 {'Question': 'What should be done when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance for a person in cardiac arrest?',
  'Answer': "When calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance for a person in cardiac arrest, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby 'Get an Automated External Defibrillator'. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty."},
 {'Question': 'What has research shown to be the key factor in improving the chances of survival for cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF)?',
  'Answer': 'Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) combined with early defibrillation has been shown to improve survival rates.'}]

[{'Question': 'What is the most common underlying cardiac rhythm at the time of a sudden cardiac arrest?',
  'Answer': 'The most common underlying cardiac rhythm at the time of a sudden cardiac arrest is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse.'},
 {'Question': 'What is the treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation, and what should be administered together with it to reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility?',
  'Answer': 'The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED), which should be administered together with chest compressions to reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility.'},
 {'Question': 'What is the consequence of delaying or not treating Ventricular Fibrillation, and what is the only treatment possible at that stage?',
  'Answer': 'The consequence of delaying or not treating Ventricular Fibrillation is that it eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this stage, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).'},
 {'Question': 'Who can perform defibrillation using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED), and what does the AED do to assist in the process?',
  'Answer': "A lay rescuer can perform defibrillation using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED), which analyzes the casualty's cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advises if a shock is needed."},
 {'Question': 'What should be done when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance in the event of a cardiac arrest, and what instruction should be given to others nearby?',
  'Answer': "When calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance in the event of a cardiac arrest, one should also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby 'Get an Automated External Defibrillator'. If you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty."}]
