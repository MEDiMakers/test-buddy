"What is the recommended action to take after checking for normal breathing and pulse during CPR, and what should be provided continuously?","Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands. ",0

The heart has two halves. The right side receives low oxygen blood from all parts of the body through veins and pumps it to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries to pick up oxygen. The left side receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins and delivers it to all parts of the body, including the vital organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and brain.",0
"What is the recommended action to take after checking for normal breathing and pulse during CPR, and what should be provided continuously?","The heart muscles receive oxygen rich blood via a set of coronary arteries.  The pumping action of the heart is initiated by electrical signals from a pacemaker (sinoatrial or SA node), these signals travel to other parts of the heart in an orderly manner through a conductive network. The electrical signals from the heart can be picked up by an electrocardiogram (ECG). The pumping action gives rise to an organized heart-beat at regular rate of 60-100 beats per minute in a normal person. ",0

The extracted oxygen is passed to the blood within the capillaries of the lungs. The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart.  Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs  The remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life. ",0

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.

When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops.

"What is the recommended action to take after checking for normal breathing and pulse during CPR, and what should be provided continuously?","When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",1

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.

"What is the recommended action to take after checking for normal breathing and pulse during CPR, and what should be provided continuously?","When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",1

"What is the recommended action to take after checking for normal breathing and pulse during CPR, and what should be provided continuously?","3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",1
"What is the recommended action to take after checking for normal breathing and pulse during CPR, and what should be provided continuously?","3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.

"What is the recommended action to take after checking for normal breathing and pulse during CPR, and what should be provided continuously?","3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",0

"What is the recommended action to take after checking for normal breathing and pulse during CPR, and what should be provided continuously?","3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9.

If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.   Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.  - If the casualty is sitting, the rescuer kneels  and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.    Step 3: Location of landmark   - Place your arms under the casualty’s armpits encircling the chest.  - Make a fist with one hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place thumb-side of fist on the middle of the casualty’s sternum (breastbone).   Step 4: Chest thrusts   - Grasp your fist with your other hand and bring yourself close to the casualty before giving quick backward thrusts .  - Deliver each backward thrust firmly and distinctly. Perform  continuous backward chest thrusts with the intent of relieving the obstruction until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.      5.6: RELIEF OF UNCONSCIOUS ADULT/CHILD  FBAO   If the casualty becomes unconscious, proceed with the following steps.  Step 1: Position the casualty   - Support and position the casualty lying on his/her back on a firm flat surface .  Step 2: Activate the Emergency Medical Service (EMS)   - Rescuer shouts: “Help! Call ambulance 995  and get an AED !” However, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.

If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.    - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.   - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.    Note:   1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.   2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you m ay take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions).

"What is the recommended action to take after checking for normal breathing and pulse during CPR, and what should be provided continuously?","6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

"What is the recommended action to take after checking for normal breathing and pulse during CPR, and what should be provided continuously?","(C) Chest Compressions   - Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home.

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0

A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B.

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ",1

When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops.

"What is the phone number that should be called to get help during a cardiac arrest emergency in Singapore, and what service should be requested?","When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",0

First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

"What is the phone number that should be called to get help during a cardiac arrest emergency in Singapore, and what service should be requested?","Recommendation for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Use in Children  The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) advocates early use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) on children to analyse rhythms and provide defibrillation in cases of cardiac arrest with shockable rhythms. When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose. If a paediatric dose-attenuating system is unavailable, then a standard Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be used.",0

Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.

Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.

"What is the phone number that should be called to get help during a cardiac arrest emergency in Singapore, and what service should be requested?","3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",1

Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.

"What is the phone number that should be called to get help during a cardiac arrest emergency in Singapore, and what service should be requested?","3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",0

"What is the phone number that should be called to get help during a cardiac arrest emergency in Singapore, and what service should be requested?","3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9.

Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.   - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.    Note:   1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.   2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you m ay take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions).

"What is the phone number that should be called to get help during a cardiac arrest emergency in Singapore, and what service should be requested?","6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

"What is the phone number that should be called to get help during a cardiac arrest emergency in Singapore, and what service should be requested?","(C) Chest Compressions   - Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

What is the primary consideration when starting resuscitation efforts on a casualty?,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands. ",1
What is the primary consideration when starting resuscitation efforts on a casualty?,"The heart is a muscular pump located in the center of the chest and slightly towards the left.  The heart has two halves. The right side receives low oxygen blood from all parts of the body through veins and pumps it to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries to pick up oxygen. The left side receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins and delivers it to all parts of the body, including the vital organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and brain.",0
What is the primary consideration when starting resuscitation efforts on a casualty?,"The heart muscles receive oxygen rich blood via a set of coronary arteries.  The pumping action of the heart is initiated by electrical signals from a pacemaker (sinoatrial or SA node), these signals travel to other parts of the heart in an orderly manner through a conductive network. The electrical signals from the heart can be picked up by an electrocardiogram (ECG). The pumping action gives rise to an organized heart-beat at regular rate of 60-100 beats per minute in a normal person. ",0
What is the primary consideration when starting resuscitation efforts on a casualty?,"On an electrocardiogram (ECG), normal heart rhythm, also known as the Normal Sinus Rhythm, appears as below: 5 large squares = 1second 1 small square = 0.04 s  1 large square = 0.2 s 1 QRS per second Heart rate = 60 per minute Count the number of large intervals and divide into 300 squares between 2 RR The human body has two lungs which absorb oxygen from the air that is breathed in. 21% of air consists of oxygen, of which 5% is extracted by the lungs. The extracted oxygen is passed to the blood within the capillaries of the lungs. The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart.  Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs  The remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life. ",1

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0

A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked.

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ",0

When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops.

What is the primary consideration when starting resuscitation efforts on a casualty?,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",1

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose.

Allow the casualty to cough to expel the object himself/herself. In complete airway obstruction, the casualty is unable to speak, breathe or cough and may become cyanotic (blue). The casualty will clutch the neck with thumb and fingers, the universal distress signal for choking that requires immediate action.",0

It guides the assessment and response to choking incidents. Assess severity The first step is to assess the severity of the airway obstruction. Based on the assessment, the flowchart divides into two categories: Mild and Severe. Mild - Partial Airway Obstruction (Able to produce sound, breathe or cough).  - Do not interfere   - Allow the casualty to clear airway by coughing. Continue to check for deterioration (inability to produce sound, breathe or cough) or until obstruction is relieved. Consider calling 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) if repeated attempts by casualty are not successful *Avoid feeding the casualty water/food and do not shake the casualty in a attempt to dislodge the foreign body.  Severe  - Complete Airway Obstruction (Unable to produce sound, breathe or cough).  - Conscious    - Continuous abdominal thrusts or chest thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or casualty becomes unconscious. Chest thrusts for obese or pregnant casualty. - Unconscious    - Place casualty in a supine position on a flat and firm surface. Call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) and get an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) if visible and nearby. Start 30 chest compressions.

What is the primary consideration when starting resuscitation efforts on a casualty?,"5.3: RELIEF OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO) Techniques used to relieve Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) include the Heimlich Manoeuvre (abdominal thrusts) and chest thrusts for pregnant and obese casualties. The Heimlich Manoeuvre, also known as the sub-diaphragmatic abdominal thrusts or abdominal thrusts is recommended for the relief of Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) in responsive adults (aged > 12 years) and children (aged 1 – 12 years). The Heimlich Manoeuvre elevates the diaphragm and increase airway pressure, which forces air out from the lungs. This creates an artificial cough which can expel the foreign body from the airway. In obese or pregnant casualties, chest thrusts should be used instead of abdominal thrusts.",0

What is the primary consideration when starting resuscitation efforts on a casualty?,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.  Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.",1

What is the primary consideration when starting resuscitation efforts on a casualty?,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",1

What is the primary consideration when starting resuscitation efforts on a casualty?,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",1
What is the primary consideration when starting resuscitation efforts on a casualty?,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",1
What is the primary consideration when starting resuscitation efforts on a casualty?,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",1

Steps for Applying Automated External Defibrillator Pads: (1)Open the packet containing Automated External Defibrillator pads with cable and connector. (2)Peel off the protective backing from the pads. (3)Follow the pictures on the pads to determine their correct location on the chest. (4)Press the pads firmly onto the chest wall. (5)Stand clear when the Automated External Defibrillator is analyzing the heart rhythm. (6)Stand clear when pressing the button to deliver the shock.

What is the primary consideration when starting resuscitation efforts on a casualty?,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b.

If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.   Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.  - If the casualty is sitting, the rescuer kneels  and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.    Step 3: Location of landmark   - Place your arms under the casualty’s armpits encircling the chest.  - Make a fist with one hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place thumb-side of fist on the middle of the casualty’s sternum (breastbone).   Step 4: Chest thrusts   - Grasp your fist with your other hand and bring yourself close to the casualty before giving quick backward thrusts .  - Deliver each backward thrust firmly and distinctly.

An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.   - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.    Note:   1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.   2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions.

What is the primary consideration when starting resuscitation efforts on a casualty?,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

What is the primary consideration when starting resuscitation efforts on a casualty?,"(C) Chest Compressions   - Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

"What action should the rescuer take if the casualty is found in an unsafe location, such as a road open to traffic?","Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands. ",0
"What action should the rescuer take if the casualty is found in an unsafe location, such as a road open to traffic?","The heart is a muscular pump located in the center of the chest and slightly towards the left.  The heart has two halves. The right side receives low oxygen blood from all parts of the body through veins and pumps it to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries to pick up oxygen. The left side receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins and delivers it to all parts of the body, including the vital organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and brain.",0
"What action should the rescuer take if the casualty is found in an unsafe location, such as a road open to traffic?","The heart muscles receive oxygen rich blood via a set of coronary arteries.  The pumping action of the heart is initiated by electrical signals from a pacemaker (sinoatrial or SA node), these signals travel to other parts of the heart in an orderly manner through a conductive network. The electrical signals from the heart can be picked up by an electrocardiogram (ECG). The pumping action gives rise to an organized heart-beat at regular rate of 60-100 beats per minute in a normal person. ",0

The extracted oxygen is passed to the blood within the capillaries of the lungs. The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart.  Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs  The remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life. ",0

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0

A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B.

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ",0
"What action should the rescuer take if the casualty is found in an unsafe location, such as a road open to traffic?","1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops. Heart will soon stop beating. 4-6 minutes: Brain damage possible. 6-10 minutes: Brain damage likely. Over 10 minutes: Irreversible brain damage certain.",0
"What action should the rescuer take if the casualty is found in an unsafe location, such as a road open to traffic?","When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",0

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

For example, more than 3000 people suffer from Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA), with a survival rate of just 5%, which could be improved by simple medical intervention within the first few critical minutes. At the same time, there are more than 1,000 minor fires (such as rubbish chute/bin fire) that could easily be extinguished using publicly-available means.

"What action should the rescuer take if the casualty is found in an unsafe location, such as a road open to traffic?","3.9: CHILD/INFANT DEFIBRILLATION Use of Automated External Defibrillator (AED) in Children  Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in children are usually from non-cardiac causes with majority of the casualties presenting with non-shockable cardiac rhythms (asystole or pulseless electrical activity).  Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%. School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.",0
"What action should the rescuer take if the casualty is found in an unsafe location, such as a road open to traffic?","Recommendation for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Use in Children  The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) advocates early use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) on children to analyse rhythms and provide defibrillation in cases of cardiac arrest with shockable rhythms. When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose. If a paediatric dose-attenuating system is unavailable, then a standard Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be used.",0

(R) Check for Responsiveness  - The rescuer should tap the child’s shoulders firmly and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’ - Avoid violent shaking of the child as this may result in injury. - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.  For Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) to be effective, the casualty must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface.

The Heimlich Manoeuvre, also known as the sub-diaphragmatic abdominal thrusts or abdominal thrusts is recommended for the relief of Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) in responsive adults (aged > 12 years) and children (aged 1 – 12 years). The Heimlich Manoeuvre elevates the diaphragm and increase airway pressure, which forces air out from the lungs. This creates an artificial cough which can expel the foreign body from the airway. In obese or pregnant casualties, chest thrusts should be used instead of abdominal thrusts.",0

"What action should the rescuer take if the casualty is found in an unsafe location, such as a road open to traffic?","INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.  Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.",0

"What action should the rescuer take if the casualty is found in an unsafe location, such as a road open to traffic?","When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",0

"What action should the rescuer take if the casualty is found in an unsafe location, such as a road open to traffic?","Resuscitation training should simulate the environment that rescuers may find themselves in. For example, healthcare providers should practice resuscitation skills on manikins on a trolley bed  or stand on a step stool at the side of the trolley bed. This is to ensure the elbows can be straightened to facilitate chest compressions. 2.16 –Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on a trolley bed For resuscitation involving two or more rescuers, one rescuer can focus on chest compressions with the other handling the ventilations. Additional rescuers can be delegated with other tasks such as calling 995 for SCDF or retrieving and using the Automated external defibrillator (AED). Although chest compressions are commonly performed by kneeling at the side of the casualty, there may be specific circumstances involving narrow alleys, walkways or corridors where the rescuer may have to perform chest compressions by positioning over the head instead of the usual lateral side.  2.17 – Overhead CPR In the case of a passenger aircraft, a rescuer should kneel in the leg-space in front of the aisle seats to perform chest compressions if the casualty cannot be transferred within a few seconds to an area with adequate floor space such as the galley",0
"What action should the rescuer take if the casualty is found in an unsafe location, such as a road open to traffic?","3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",0
"What action should the rescuer take if the casualty is found in an unsafe location, such as a road open to traffic?","3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",0
"What action should the rescuer take if the casualty is found in an unsafe location, such as a road open to traffic?","3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",1

Steps for Applying Automated External Defibrillator Pads: (1)Open the packet containing Automated External Defibrillator pads with cable and connector. (2)Peel off the protective backing from the pads. (3)Follow the pictures on the pads to determine their correct location on the chest. (4)Press the pads firmly onto the chest wall. (5)Stand clear when the Automated External Defibrillator is analyzing the heart rhythm. (6)Stand clear when pressing the button to deliver the shock.

"What action should the rescuer take if the casualty is found in an unsafe location, such as a road open to traffic?","3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9. Throughout this period, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should remain connected to the casualty.",0

If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.    - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand .

"What action should the rescuer take if the casualty is found in an unsafe location, such as a road open to traffic?","6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

"What is the recommended method for checking a casualty's responsiveness, and what should be avoided during this process?","Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands. ",0
"What is the recommended method for checking a casualty's responsiveness, and what should be avoided during this process?","The heart is a muscular pump located in the center of the chest and slightly towards the left.  The heart has two halves. The right side receives low oxygen blood from all parts of the body through veins and pumps it to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries to pick up oxygen. The left side receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins and delivers it to all parts of the body, including the vital organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and brain.",0
"What is the recommended method for checking a casualty's responsiveness, and what should be avoided during this process?","The heart muscles receive oxygen rich blood via a set of coronary arteries.  The pumping action of the heart is initiated by electrical signals from a pacemaker (sinoatrial or SA node), these signals travel to other parts of the heart in an orderly manner through a conductive network. The electrical signals from the heart can be picked up by an electrocardiogram (ECG). The pumping action gives rise to an organized heart-beat at regular rate of 60-100 beats per minute in a normal person. ",0

The extracted oxygen is passed to the blood within the capillaries of the lungs. The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart.  Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs  The remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life. ",0

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0
"What is the recommended method for checking a casualty's responsiveness, and what should be avoided during this process?","1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B.

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ",0
"What is the recommended method for checking a casualty's responsiveness, and what should be avoided during this process?","1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops.

"What is the recommended method for checking a casualty's responsiveness, and what should be avoided during this process?","When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",1

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%.

The Heimlich Manoeuvre, also known as the sub-diaphragmatic abdominal thrusts or abdominal thrusts is recommended for the relief of Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) in responsive adults (aged > 12 years) and children (aged 1 – 12 years). The Heimlich Manoeuvre elevates the diaphragm and increase airway pressure, which forces air out from the lungs. This creates an artificial cough which can expel the foreign body from the airway. In obese or pregnant casualties, chest thrusts should be used instead of abdominal thrusts.",0

"What is the recommended method for checking a casualty's responsiveness, and what should be avoided during this process?","INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.  Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.",0

"What is the recommended method for checking a casualty's responsiveness, and what should be avoided during this process?","When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",0

"What is the recommended method for checking a casualty's responsiveness, and what should be avoided during this process?","3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",0
"What is the recommended method for checking a casualty's responsiveness, and what should be avoided during this process?","3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",0
"What is the recommended method for checking a casualty's responsiveness, and what should be avoided during this process?","3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",0

"What is the recommended method for checking a casualty's responsiveness, and what should be avoided during this process?","3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9. Throughout this period, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should remain connected to the casualty.",0

If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.

"What is the recommended method for checking a casualty's responsiveness, and what should be avoided during this process?","6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

In what type of situations should the casualty be removed to a safe location as soon as possible?,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands. ",0
In what type of situations should the casualty be removed to a safe location as soon as possible?,"The heart is a muscular pump located in the center of the chest and slightly towards the left.  The heart has two halves. The right side receives low oxygen blood from all parts of the body through veins and pumps it to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries to pick up oxygen. The left side receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins and delivers it to all parts of the body, including the vital organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and brain.",0
In what type of situations should the casualty be removed to a safe location as soon as possible?,"The heart muscles receive oxygen rich blood via a set of coronary arteries.  The pumping action of the heart is initiated by electrical signals from a pacemaker (sinoatrial or SA node), these signals travel to other parts of the heart in an orderly manner through a conductive network. The electrical signals from the heart can be picked up by an electrocardiogram (ECG). The pumping action gives rise to an organized heart-beat at regular rate of 60-100 beats per minute in a normal person. ",0
In what type of situations should the casualty be removed to a safe location as soon as possible?,"On an electrocardiogram (ECG), normal heart rhythm, also known as the Normal Sinus Rhythm, appears as below: 5 large squares = 1second 1 small square = 0.04 s  1 large square = 0.2 s 1 QRS per second Heart rate = 60 per minute Count the number of large intervals and divide into 300 squares between 2 RR The human body has two lungs which absorb oxygen from the air that is breathed in. 21% of air consists of oxygen, of which 5% is extracted by the lungs. The extracted oxygen is passed to the blood within the capillaries of the lungs. The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart.  Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs  The remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life. ",0
In what type of situations should the casualty be removed to a safe location as soon as possible?,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ",0
In what type of situations should the casualty be removed to a safe location as soon as possible?,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops. Heart will soon stop beating. 4-6 minutes: Brain damage possible. 6-10 minutes: Brain damage likely. Over 10 minutes: Irreversible brain damage certain.",0
In what type of situations should the casualty be removed to a safe location as soon as possible?,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",1

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%. School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.",0

It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose.

Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).

In what type of situations should the casualty be removed to a safe location as soon as possible?,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",0

In what type of situations should the casualty be removed to a safe location as soon as possible?,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",1
In what type of situations should the casualty be removed to a safe location as soon as possible?,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",0
In what type of situations should the casualty be removed to a safe location as soon as possible?,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",1

In what type of situations should the casualty be removed to a safe location as soon as possible?,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9.

Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.   Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.  - If the casualty is sitting, the rescuer kneels  and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.    Step 3: Location of landmark   - Place your arms under the casualty’s armpits encircling the chest.  - Make a fist with one hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place thumb-side of fist on the middle of the casualty’s sternum (breastbone).   Step 4: Chest thrusts   - Grasp your fist with your other hand and bring yourself close to the casualty before giving quick backward thrusts .  - Deliver each backward thrust firmly and distinctly. Perform  continuous backward chest thrusts with the intent of relieving the obstruction until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.      5.6: RELIEF OF UNCONSCIOUS ADULT/CHILD  FBAO   If the casualty becomes unconscious, proceed with the following steps.  Step 1: Position the casualty   - Support and position the casualty lying on his/her back on a firm flat surface .  Step 2: Activate the Emergency Medical Service (EMS)   - Rescuer shouts: “Help! Call ambulance 995  and get an AED !” However, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.   Step 3: Start 30 chest compressions   Locate the landmark and perform 30 chest compressions using the same location and techniques used for chest compressions in CPR.

Take care not to force the foreign body deeper into the throat. This manoeuvre is known as the finger sweep .  Note:   - Do not perform blind finger sweep. Blind finger sweep may push the object back or further into the airway.   - However, if there are no objects found in the mouth, repeat steps 3 and 4 until object has been removed.   - For lay rescuers – Once object has been removed, check for breathing. If breathing is absent, repeat steps 3 and 4 until breathing resumes or emergency help arrives.  For trained healthcare providers – See step 5. ",0

If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.    - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.   - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.    Note:   1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.   2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you m ay take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions).

In what type of situations should the casualty be removed to a safe location as soon as possible?,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.  ",1
In what type of situations should the casualty be removed to a safe location as soon as possible?,"(C) Chest Compressions   - Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

What precaution should be taken when handling a casualty with suspected head or neck injuries?,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands. ",0
What precaution should be taken when handling a casualty with suspected head or neck injuries?,"The heart is a muscular pump located in the center of the chest and slightly towards the left.  The heart has two halves. The right side receives low oxygen blood from all parts of the body through veins and pumps it to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries to pick up oxygen. The left side receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins and delivers it to all parts of the body, including the vital organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and brain.",0
What precaution should be taken when handling a casualty with suspected head or neck injuries?,"The heart muscles receive oxygen rich blood via a set of coronary arteries.  The pumping action of the heart is initiated by electrical signals from a pacemaker (sinoatrial or SA node), these signals travel to other parts of the heart in an orderly manner through a conductive network. The electrical signals from the heart can be picked up by an electrocardiogram (ECG). The pumping action gives rise to an organized heart-beat at regular rate of 60-100 beats per minute in a normal person. ",0
What precaution should be taken when handling a casualty with suspected head or neck injuries?,"On an electrocardiogram (ECG), normal heart rhythm, also known as the Normal Sinus Rhythm, appears as below: 5 large squares = 1second 1 small square = 0.04 s  1 large square = 0.2 s 1 QRS per second Heart rate = 60 per minute Count the number of large intervals and divide into 300 squares between 2 RR The human body has two lungs which absorb oxygen from the air that is breathed in. 21% of air consists of oxygen, of which 5% is extracted by the lungs. The extracted oxygen is passed to the blood within the capillaries of the lungs. The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart.  Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs  The remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life. ",0
What precaution should be taken when handling a casualty with suspected head or neck injuries?,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0
What precaution should be taken when handling a casualty with suspected head or neck injuries?,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.  Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ",0
What precaution should be taken when handling a casualty with suspected head or neck injuries?,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops.

What precaution should be taken when handling a casualty with suspected head or neck injuries?,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",0

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%.

It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose.

The Heimlich Manoeuvre, also known as the sub-diaphragmatic abdominal thrusts or abdominal thrusts is recommended for the relief of Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) in responsive adults (aged > 12 years) and children (aged 1 – 12 years). The Heimlich Manoeuvre elevates the diaphragm and increase airway pressure, which forces air out from the lungs. This creates an artificial cough which can expel the foreign body from the airway. In obese or pregnant casualties, chest thrusts should be used instead of abdominal thrusts.",0

What precaution should be taken when handling a casualty with suspected head or neck injuries?,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.  Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.",0

What precaution should be taken when handling a casualty with suspected head or neck injuries?,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",0

What precaution should be taken when handling a casualty with suspected head or neck injuries?,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",0
What precaution should be taken when handling a casualty with suspected head or neck injuries?,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",0
What precaution should be taken when handling a casualty with suspected head or neck injuries?,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",0

Left Pad: Place the other pad just below and to the left of the left nipple. Steps for Applying Automated External Defibrillator Pads: (1)Open the packet containing Automated External Defibrillator pads with cable and connector. (2)Peel off the protective backing from the pads. (3)Follow the pictures on the pads to determine their correct location on the chest. (4)Press the pads firmly onto the chest wall. (5)Stand clear when the Automated External Defibrillator is analyzing the heart rhythm. (6)Stand clear when pressing the button to deliver the shock.

What precaution should be taken when handling a casualty with suspected head or neck injuries?,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9. Throughout this period, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should remain connected to the casualty.",1

If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.

An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.   - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.    Note:   1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.   2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions.

What precaution should be taken when handling a casualty with suspected head or neck injuries?,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

What precaution should be taken when handling a casualty with suspected head or neck injuries?,"(C) Chest Compressions   - Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

What is the essential position of the casualty for Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to be effective?,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs).

The extracted oxygen is passed to the blood within the capillaries of the lungs. The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart.  Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs  The remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life. ",1

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0

(See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.  Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ",0

When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops. Heart will soon stop beating. 4-6 minutes: Brain damage possible. 6-10 minutes: Brain damage likely. Over 10 minutes: Irreversible brain damage certain.",1
What is the essential position of the casualty for Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to be effective?,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",1

What is the essential position of the casualty for Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to be effective?,"1.7: THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL The essential steps for helping a cardiac arrest victim are illustrated in a system called the “Chain of Survival”. The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%. School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.",0

When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose. If a paediatric dose-attenuating system is unavailable, then a standard Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be used.",0

Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).

What is the essential position of the casualty for Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to be effective?,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",1

What is the essential position of the casualty for Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to be effective?,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",1
What is the essential position of the casualty for Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to be effective?,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",1
What is the essential position of the casualty for Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to be effective?,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",1

What is the essential position of the casualty for Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to be effective?,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9.

Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.   Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.  - If the casualty is sitting, the rescuer kneels  and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.    Step 3: Location of landmark   - Place your arms under the casualty’s armpits encircling the chest.  - Make a fist with one hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place thumb-side of fist on the middle of the casualty’s sternum (breastbone).   Step 4: Chest thrusts   - Grasp your fist with your other hand and bring yourself close to the casualty before giving quick backward thrusts .  - Deliver each backward thrust firmly and distinctly. Perform  continuous backward chest thrusts with the intent of relieving the obstruction until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.      5.6: RELIEF OF UNCONSCIOUS ADULT/CHILD  FBAO   If the casualty becomes unconscious, proceed with the following steps.  Step 1: Position the casualty   - Support and position the casualty lying on his/her back on a firm flat surface .  Step 2: Activate the Emergency Medical Service (EMS)   - Rescuer shouts: “Help! Call ambulance 995  and get an AED !” However, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.   Step 3: Start 30 chest compressions   Locate the landmark and perform 30 chest compressions using the same location and techniques used for chest compressions in CPR.

Take care not to force the foreign body deeper into the throat. This manoeuvre is known as the finger sweep .  Note:   - Do not perform blind finger sweep. Blind finger sweep may push the object back or further into the airway.   - However, if there are no objects found in the mouth, repeat steps 3 and 4 until object has been removed.   - For lay rescuers – Once object has been removed, check for breathing. If breathing is absent, repeat steps 3 and 4 until breathing resumes or emergency help arrives.  For trained healthcare providers – See step 5. ",1

If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.    - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.   - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.    Note:   1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.   2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you m ay take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions).

What is the essential position of the casualty for Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to be effective?,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

What should the rescuer do if the casualty is lying face down (prone position) or on his/her side?,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands. ",0
What should the rescuer do if the casualty is lying face down (prone position) or on his/her side?,"The heart is a muscular pump located in the center of the chest and slightly towards the left.  The heart has two halves. The right side receives low oxygen blood from all parts of the body through veins and pumps it to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries to pick up oxygen. The left side receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins and delivers it to all parts of the body, including the vital organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and brain.",0
What should the rescuer do if the casualty is lying face down (prone position) or on his/her side?,"The heart muscles receive oxygen rich blood via a set of coronary arteries.  The pumping action of the heart is initiated by electrical signals from a pacemaker (sinoatrial or SA node), these signals travel to other parts of the heart in an orderly manner through a conductive network. The electrical signals from the heart can be picked up by an electrocardiogram (ECG). The pumping action gives rise to an organized heart-beat at regular rate of 60-100 beats per minute in a normal person. ",0
What should the rescuer do if the casualty is lying face down (prone position) or on his/her side?,"On an electrocardiogram (ECG), normal heart rhythm, also known as the Normal Sinus Rhythm, appears as below: 5 large squares = 1second 1 small square = 0.04 s  1 large square = 0.2 s 1 QRS per second Heart rate = 60 per minute Count the number of large intervals and divide into 300 squares between 2 RR The human body has two lungs which absorb oxygen from the air that is breathed in. 21% of air consists of oxygen, of which 5% is extracted by the lungs. The extracted oxygen is passed to the blood within the capillaries of the lungs. The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart.  Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs  The remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life. ",1

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0
What should the rescuer do if the casualty is lying face down (prone position) or on his/her side?,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.  Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ",0
What should the rescuer do if the casualty is lying face down (prone position) or on his/her side?,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops. Heart will soon stop beating. 4-6 minutes: Brain damage possible. 6-10 minutes: Brain damage likely. Over 10 minutes: Irreversible brain damage certain.",0
What should the rescuer do if the casualty is lying face down (prone position) or on his/her side?,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",0

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%.

It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose.

The Heimlich Manoeuvre, also known as the sub-diaphragmatic abdominal thrusts or abdominal thrusts is recommended for the relief of Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) in responsive adults (aged > 12 years) and children (aged 1 – 12 years). The Heimlich Manoeuvre elevates the diaphragm and increase airway pressure, which forces air out from the lungs. This creates an artificial cough which can expel the foreign body from the airway. In obese or pregnant casualties, chest thrusts should be used instead of abdominal thrusts.",0

What should the rescuer do if the casualty is lying face down (prone position) or on his/her side?,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.  Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.",0

What should the rescuer do if the casualty is lying face down (prone position) or on his/her side?,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",0

If both the breathing and pulse are present, maintain the casualty in a supine position and continuously monitor the casualty until help arrives",0
What should the rescuer do if the casualty is lying face down (prone position) or on his/her side?,"Resuscitation training should simulate the environment that rescuers may find themselves in. For example, healthcare providers should practice resuscitation skills on manikins on a trolley bed  or stand on a step stool at the side of the trolley bed. This is to ensure the elbows can be straightened to facilitate chest compressions. 2.16 –Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on a trolley bed For resuscitation involving two or more rescuers, one rescuer can focus on chest compressions with the other handling the ventilations. Additional rescuers can be delegated with other tasks such as calling 995 for SCDF or retrieving and using the Automated external defibrillator (AED). Although chest compressions are commonly performed by kneeling at the side of the casualty, there may be specific circumstances involving narrow alleys, walkways or corridors where the rescuer may have to perform chest compressions by positioning over the head instead of the usual lateral side.  2.17 – Overhead CPR In the case of a passenger aircraft, a rescuer should kneel in the leg-space in front of the aisle seats to perform chest compressions if the casualty cannot be transferred within a few seconds to an area with adequate floor space such as the galley",1
What should the rescuer do if the casualty is lying face down (prone position) or on his/her side?,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",0
What should the rescuer do if the casualty is lying face down (prone position) or on his/her side?,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",1
What should the rescuer do if the casualty is lying face down (prone position) or on his/her side?,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",1

Left Pad: Place the other pad just below and to the left of the left nipple. Steps for Applying Automated External Defibrillator Pads: (1)Open the packet containing Automated External Defibrillator pads with cable and connector. (2)Peel off the protective backing from the pads. (3)Follow the pictures on the pads to determine their correct location on the chest. (4)Press the pads firmly onto the chest wall. (5)Stand clear when the Automated External Defibrillator is analyzing the heart rhythm. (6)Stand clear when pressing the button to deliver the shock.

What should the rescuer do if the casualty is lying face down (prone position) or on his/her side?,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9. Throughout this period, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should remain connected to the casualty.",0

If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.

What should the rescuer do if the casualty is lying face down (prone position) or on his/her side?,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

What should the rescuer do if the casualty is lying face down (prone position) or on his/her side?,"(C) Chest Compressions   - Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

What is the first step to take if an adult is unresponsive and you are alone with no bystanders?,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands. ",1

What is the first step to take if an adult is unresponsive and you are alone with no bystanders?,"The heart muscles receive oxygen rich blood via a set of coronary arteries.  The pumping action of the heart is initiated by electrical signals from a pacemaker (sinoatrial or SA node), these signals travel to other parts of the heart in an orderly manner through a conductive network. The electrical signals from the heart can be picked up by an electrocardiogram (ECG). The pumping action gives rise to an organized heart-beat at regular rate of 60-100 beats per minute in a normal person. ",0
What is the first step to take if an adult is unresponsive and you are alone with no bystanders?,"On an electrocardiogram (ECG), normal heart rhythm, also known as the Normal Sinus Rhythm, appears as below: 5 large squares = 1second 1 small square = 0.04 s  1 large square = 0.2 s 1 QRS per second Heart rate = 60 per minute Count the number of large intervals and divide into 300 squares between 2 RR The human body has two lungs which absorb oxygen from the air that is breathed in. 21% of air consists of oxygen, of which 5% is extracted by the lungs. The extracted oxygen is passed to the blood within the capillaries of the lungs. The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart.  Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs  The remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life. ",0

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0

A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.  Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ",0

When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops.

What is the first step to take if an adult is unresponsive and you are alone with no bystanders?,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",1

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%.

When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose.

What is the first step to take if an adult is unresponsive and you are alone with no bystanders?,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",1

What is the first step to take if an adult is unresponsive and you are alone with no bystanders?,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",1
What is the first step to take if an adult is unresponsive and you are alone with no bystanders?,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",0
What is the first step to take if an adult is unresponsive and you are alone with no bystanders?,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",0

What is the first step to take if an adult is unresponsive and you are alone with no bystanders?,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9.

If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.

What is the first step to take if an adult is unresponsive and you are alone with no bystanders?,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

What is the purpose of calling 995 for SCDF EMS in a cardiac arrest situation?,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home.

What is the purpose of calling 995 for SCDF EMS in a cardiac arrest situation?,"The heart muscles receive oxygen rich blood via a set of coronary arteries.  The pumping action of the heart is initiated by electrical signals from a pacemaker (sinoatrial or SA node), these signals travel to other parts of the heart in an orderly manner through a conductive network. The electrical signals from the heart can be picked up by an electrocardiogram (ECG). The pumping action gives rise to an organized heart-beat at regular rate of 60-100 beats per minute in a normal person. ",0

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0

A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked.

The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.  Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ",1

When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops. Heart will soon stop beating. 4-6 minutes: Brain damage possible. 6-10 minutes: Brain damage likely. Over 10 minutes: Irreversible brain damage certain.",0
What is the purpose of calling 995 for SCDF EMS in a cardiac arrest situation?,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",0

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

What is the purpose of calling 995 for SCDF EMS in a cardiac arrest situation?,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.  Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.",0

What is the purpose of calling 995 for SCDF EMS in a cardiac arrest situation?,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.

For example, healthcare providers should practice resuscitation skills on manikins on a trolley bed  or stand on a step stool at the side of the trolley bed. This is to ensure the elbows can be straightened to facilitate chest compressions. 2.16 –Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on a trolley bed For resuscitation involving two or more rescuers, one rescuer can focus on chest compressions with the other handling the ventilations. Additional rescuers can be delegated with other tasks such as calling 995 for SCDF or retrieving and using the Automated external defibrillator (AED). Although chest compressions are commonly performed by kneeling at the side of the casualty, there may be specific circumstances involving narrow alleys, walkways or corridors where the rescuer may have to perform chest compressions by positioning over the head instead of the usual lateral side.  2.17 – Overhead CPR In the case of a passenger aircraft, a rescuer should kneel in the leg-space in front of the aisle seats to perform chest compressions if the casualty cannot be transferred within a few seconds to an area with adequate floor space such as the galley",1
What is the purpose of calling 995 for SCDF EMS in a cardiac arrest situation?,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",1
What is the purpose of calling 995 for SCDF EMS in a cardiac arrest situation?,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",0
What is the purpose of calling 995 for SCDF EMS in a cardiac arrest situation?,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",0

What is the purpose of calling 995 for SCDF EMS in a cardiac arrest situation?,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9.

What is the purpose of calling 995 for SCDF EMS in a cardiac arrest situation?,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands. ",0

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ",1

When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops.

What mode should the handphone be put on when calling 995 for SCDF EMS if you are alone with the casualty?,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",0

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

What mode should the handphone be put on when calling 995 for SCDF EMS if you are alone with the casualty?,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.

What mode should the handphone be put on when calling 995 for SCDF EMS if you are alone with the casualty?,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",1

Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.

Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",0

The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9. Throughout this period, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should remain connected to the casualty.",0

If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.

If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.    - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand .

Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

What is the first action a lone rescuer should take when finding an unresponsive casualty in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service?,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands. ",0
What is the first action a lone rescuer should take when finding an unresponsive casualty in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service?,"The heart is a muscular pump located in the center of the chest and slightly towards the left.  The heart has two halves. The right side receives low oxygen blood from all parts of the body through veins and pumps it to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries to pick up oxygen. The left side receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins and delivers it to all parts of the body, including the vital organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and brain.",0
What is the first action a lone rescuer should take when finding an unresponsive casualty in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service?,"The heart muscles receive oxygen rich blood via a set of coronary arteries.  The pumping action of the heart is initiated by electrical signals from a pacemaker (sinoatrial or SA node), these signals travel to other parts of the heart in an orderly manner through a conductive network. The electrical signals from the heart can be picked up by an electrocardiogram (ECG). The pumping action gives rise to an organized heart-beat at regular rate of 60-100 beats per minute in a normal person. ",0

The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart.  Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs  The remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life. ",1

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0

A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B.

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ",0
What is the first action a lone rescuer should take when finding an unresponsive casualty in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service?,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops.

What is the first action a lone rescuer should take when finding an unresponsive casualty in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service?,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",1

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%. School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.",0

When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose. If a paediatric dose-attenuating system is unavailable, then a standard Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be used.",0

Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.

Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",1

What is the first action a lone rescuer should take when finding an unresponsive casualty in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service?,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",1
What is the first action a lone rescuer should take when finding an unresponsive casualty in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service?,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",0
What is the first action a lone rescuer should take when finding an unresponsive casualty in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service?,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",1

The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9. Throughout this period, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should remain connected to the casualty.",0

If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.    - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand .

What is the first action a lone rescuer should take when finding an unresponsive casualty in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service?,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

"If a casualty is found to have no normal breathing, how long should chest compressions be continued before leaving the casualty to seek help?","Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands. ",0
"If a casualty is found to have no normal breathing, how long should chest compressions be continued before leaving the casualty to seek help?","The heart is a muscular pump located in the center of the chest and slightly towards the left.  The heart has two halves. The right side receives low oxygen blood from all parts of the body through veins and pumps it to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries to pick up oxygen.

"If a casualty is found to have no normal breathing, how long should chest compressions be continued before leaving the casualty to seek help?","The heart muscles receive oxygen rich blood via a set of coronary arteries.  The pumping action of the heart is initiated by electrical signals from a pacemaker (sinoatrial or SA node), these signals travel to other parts of the heart in an orderly manner through a conductive network. The electrical signals from the heart can be picked up by an electrocardiogram (ECG). The pumping action gives rise to an organized heart-beat at regular rate of 60-100 beats per minute in a normal person. ",0

The extracted oxygen is passed to the blood within the capillaries of the lungs. The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart.  Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs  The remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life. ",0

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0
"If a casualty is found to have no normal breathing, how long should chest compressions be continued before leaving the casualty to seek help?","1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked.

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ",0
"If a casualty is found to have no normal breathing, how long should chest compressions be continued before leaving the casualty to seek help?","1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops. Heart will soon stop beating. 4-6 minutes: Brain damage possible. 6-10 minutes: Brain damage likely. Over 10 minutes: Irreversible brain damage certain.",1
"If a casualty is found to have no normal breathing, how long should chest compressions be continued before leaving the casualty to seek help?","When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",1

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

"If a casualty is found to have no normal breathing, how long should chest compressions be continued before leaving the casualty to seek help?","INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.  Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.",0

"If a casualty is found to have no normal breathing, how long should chest compressions be continued before leaving the casualty to seek help?","When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",1

"If a casualty is found to have no normal breathing, how long should chest compressions be continued before leaving the casualty to seek help?","3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",0
"If a casualty is found to have no normal breathing, how long should chest compressions be continued before leaving the casualty to seek help?","3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",0
"If a casualty is found to have no normal breathing, how long should chest compressions be continued before leaving the casualty to seek help?","3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",0

"If a casualty is found to have no normal breathing, how long should chest compressions be continued before leaving the casualty to seek help?","3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9. Throughout this period, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should remain connected to the casualty.",1

If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.

"If a casualty is found to have no normal breathing, how long should chest compressions be continued before leaving the casualty to seek help?","6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

"If a casualty is found to have no normal breathing, how long should chest compressions be continued before leaving the casualty to seek help?","(C) Chest Compressions   - Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs).

The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart.  Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs  The remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life. ",0

These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0

A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.  Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ",0

When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops. Heart will soon stop beating. 4-6 minutes: Brain damage possible. 6-10 minutes: Brain damage likely. Over 10 minutes: Irreversible brain damage certain.",0
"What should you do if you are with someone else when you find an unresponsive casualty, and there is an AED within a 60-second walking distance?","When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",0

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%. School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.",0

When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose.

Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.  Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.",0

"What should you do if you are with someone else when you find an unresponsive casualty, and there is an AED within a 60-second walking distance?","Note:   - Do not tip-toe when performing back blows and chest thrusts as the rescuer may lose balance and fall. - Each back blow and chest thrust should be delivered with sufficient force and with the intention of expelling the foreign body. - If foreign body is seen, maintain open airway with Chin-Lift and insert the little finger of your other hand into the infant’s mouth along the inside of the cheek. - Use a hooking action to dislodge the foreign body and manoeuvre it out of the mouth. Take care not to force the foreign body deeper into the throat. This manoeuvre is known as the finger sweep.",0
"What should you do if you are with someone else when you find an unresponsive casualty, and there is an AED within a 60-second walking distance?","Note: - Do not perform blind finger sweep. Blind finger sweep may push the object back or further into the airway. - However, if there are no objects found in the mouth, repeat steps 3 and 4 until object has been removed. - For lay rescuers – Once object has been removed, check for breathing. If breathing is absent, repeat steps 3 and 4 until breathing resumes or emergency help arrives. For trained healthcare providers – See step 5.",0
"What should you do if you are with someone else when you find an unresponsive casualty, and there is an AED within a 60-second walking distance?","For Trained Healthcare Provider: Step 5: Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) ventilation - Attempt one ventilation via Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) (1st ventilation). If Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-nose-and-mouth ventilations.     - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.     - Seal your lips around the casualty’s nose and mouth.      - Provide 1 breath by blowing steadily into the infant’s mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise. Figure 7-16 – Mouth-to-mouth-and-nose ventilation  - If there is no resistance (chest rises), airway is clear. Proceed to check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  - If there is resistance (chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the infant’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. Re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).  - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.  - Check for normal breathing and pulse.  - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  - If pulse is definitely present but the infant is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at 30 breaths per minute (one breath every 2 seconds) by giving one breath and count “2-a-thousand”. Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 30 breaths. Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.  - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.",0
"What should you do if you are with someone else when you find an unresponsive casualty, and there is an AED within a 60-second walking distance?","Flow chart showing the summary of Unconscious Infant Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) Relief for Healthcare Providers: 1. Safely position the unconscious casualty on a flat and firm surface. 2. Shout for Help:    - Shout ""Help!"" and call 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (Singapore Civil Defence Force), following the dispatcher’s instructions. 3. Perform 30 chest compressions. 4. Check for Foreign Body (FB):    - If Foreign Body (FB) is seen:      - Open the mouth using Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift (HTCL) and check for a foreign body.      - Remove with a finger sweep.      - Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift (HTCL) and provide 1 ventilation.        - If chest rises:          - Check for normal breathing and pulse (not more than 10 seconds).            - If pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.            - If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within ten seconds, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).        - If chest does not rise:          - Re-attempt Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift (HTCL) and provide 1 ventilation again.            - If chest rises: Follow the same steps as above.            - If chest does not rise: Continue the cycle of chest compressions and rechecking for Foreign Body (FB).    - If no Foreign Body (FB) is seen:      - Check for normal breathing and pulse (not more than 10 seconds).        - If pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.        - If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within ten seconds, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  Note:     - HTCL stands for Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift.
