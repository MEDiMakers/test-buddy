16,At what point is brain damage likely to occur if a patient's heart has stopped beating and they are not breathing normally?,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",1.0,1,0.9527595043182373,1,0.9997901320457458

The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart.  Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs  The remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out.

The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8.

34,What are the possible areas where pain may radiate to in a person experiencing a heart attack?,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.

First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.  Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation.

104,What is the primary mechanism by which chest compressions help to circulate blood and deliver oxygen to vital organs during CPR?,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",1.0,1,0.9888916611671448,1,0.9996200799942017

Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly.

However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival.

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

The pumping action of the heart is initiated by electrical signals from a pacemaker (sinoatrial or SA node), these signals travel to other parts of the heart in an orderly manner through a conductive network. The electrical signals from the heart can be picked up by an electrocardiogram (ECG). The pumping action gives rise to an organized heart-beat at regular rate of 60-100 beats per minute in a normal person. ",1.0,1,0.9209011197090149,1,0.998236894607544

Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance.

However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.

Re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).  - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.  - Check for normal breathing and pulse.  - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  - If pulse is definitely present but the infant is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at 30 breaths per minute (one breath every 2 seconds) by giving one breath and count “2-a-thousand”. Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 30 breaths. Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.  - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.",0.0,0,5.227688961895183e-05,0,0.003531872993335128
158,"What types of resources can be used to extinguish minor fires, such as rubbish chute/bin fires, when responding to a myResponder alert?","The myResponder mobile application is available on Apple and Android stores.  myResponder works by notifying members of the public – also known as Community First Responders (CFRs) – of cardiac arrest and fire cases within 400m of their location. myResponder will also highlight nearby AEDs that may be available to responders, and provide guided advisories in the mitigation of minor fires. CFRs can then proceed to the stated location and assist by performing Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or applying an Automated external defibrillator (AED) to revive the patient, mitigating minor fires using available extinguishing means, or providing further information to SCDF’s 995 Operations Centre. Response is entirely voluntary, however, volunteers are encouraged to respond, when they are available and within safe and reasonable means. 1.18 – The above QR code works for both Apple iOS and Google Android OS and will direct to the App Store or Google Play respectively. The myResponder function is also available within the SGSecure application",1.0,1,0.8991637825965881,1,0.9985748529434204
159,"What types of resources can be used to extinguish minor fires, such as rubbish chute/bin fires, when responding to a myResponder alert?","3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",0.0,0,4.1873827285598963e-05,0,4.5606237108586356e-05
160,Which organs receive oxygen-rich blood directly from the left side of the heart?,"The heart is a muscular pump located in the center of the chest and slightly towards the left.  The heart has two halves. The right side receives low oxygen blood from all parts of the body through veins and pumps it to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries to pick up oxygen. The left side receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins and delivers it to all parts of the body, including the vital organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and brain.",1.0,1,0.9997531771659851,1,0.99977046251297
161,Which organs receive oxygen-rich blood directly from the left side of the heart?,"3.9: CHILD/INFANT DEFIBRILLATION Use of Automated External Defibrillator (AED) in Children  Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in children are usually from non-cardiac causes with majority of the casualties presenting with non-shockable cardiac rhythms (asystole or pulseless electrical activity).  Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%. School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.",0.0,0,3.5343709896551445e-05,0,4.3708645534934476e-05

The extracted oxygen is passed to the blood within the capillaries of the lungs. The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart.  Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs  The remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life.
