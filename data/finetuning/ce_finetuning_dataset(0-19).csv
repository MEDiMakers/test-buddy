"What is the percentage of total mortality in Singapore attributed to ischemic heart disease, based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019?","Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands.

"What is the percentage of total mortality in Singapore attributed to ischemic heart disease, based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019?","The heart muscles receive oxygen rich blood via a set of coronary arteries.  The pumping action of the heart is initiated by electrical signals from a pacemaker (sinoatrial or SA node), these signals travel to other parts of the heart in an orderly manner through a conductive network. The electrical signals from the heart can be picked up by an electrocardiogram (ECG). The pumping action gives rise to an organized heart-beat at regular rate of 60-100 beats per minute in a normal person. ",0.0,,,,,,

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0.0,,,,,,

A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B.

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ",0.0,,,,,,

When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops.

"What is the percentage of total mortality in Singapore attributed to ischemic heart disease, based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019?","When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",0.0,,,,,,

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

"What is the percentage of total mortality in Singapore attributed to ischemic heart disease, based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019?","INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.  Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.",0.0,,,,,,

Mild: Partial Airway Obstruction (Able to produce sound, breathe, or cough) Do not interfere: Allow the casualty to clear the airway by coughing. Continue to check for deterioration (inability to produce sound, breathe, or cough) or until obstruction is relieved. Consider calling 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS if repeated attempts by the casualty are not successful.

"What is the percentage of total mortality in Singapore attributed to ischemic heart disease, based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019?","When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",0.0,,,,,,

"What is the percentage of total mortality in Singapore attributed to ischemic heart disease, based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019?","3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",0.0,,,,,,

Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up.

Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",0.0,,,,,,

The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9. Throughout this period, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should remain connected to the casualty.",0.0,,,,,,

If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.

"What is the percentage of total mortality in Singapore attributed to ischemic heart disease, based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019?","6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

"What is the percentage of total mortality in Singapore attributed to ischemic heart disease, based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019?","(C) Chest Compressions   - Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

"In what setting do the majority of cardiac arrests occur, according to a study conducted in Singapore in 2019?","Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home.

Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.

When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.

"In what setting do the majority of cardiac arrests occur, according to a study conducted in Singapore in 2019?","When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.

Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%.

Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).

"In what setting do the majority of cardiac arrests occur, according to a study conducted in Singapore in 2019?","When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",0.0,,,,,,

"In what setting do the majority of cardiac arrests occur, according to a study conducted in Singapore in 2019?","3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",0.0,,,,,,

Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up.

Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.

"In what setting do the majority of cardiac arrests occur, according to a study conducted in Singapore in 2019?","3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8.

Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.  - If the casualty is sitting, the rescuer kneels  and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.    Step 3: Location of landmark   - Place your arms under the casualty’s armpits encircling the chest.  - Make a fist with one hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place thumb-side of fist on the middle of the casualty’s sternum (breastbone).   Step 4: Chest thrusts   - Grasp your fist with your other hand and bring yourself close to the casualty before giving quick backward thrusts .  - Deliver each backward thrust firmly and distinctly. Perform  continuous backward chest thrusts with the intent of relieving the obstruction until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.      5.6: RELIEF OF UNCONSCIOUS ADULT/CHILD  FBAO   If the casualty becomes unconscious, proceed with the following steps.  Step 1: Position the casualty   - Support and position the casualty lying on his/her back on a firm flat surface .  Step 2: Activate the Emergency Medical Service (EMS)   - Rescuer shouts: “Help! Call ambulance 995  and get an AED !” However, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.   Step 3: Start 30 chest compressions   Locate the landmark and perform 30 chest compressions using the same location and techniques used for chest compressions in CPR.

"In what setting do the majority of cardiac arrests occur, according to a study conducted in Singapore in 2019?","6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0.0,,,,,,

When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.

"What is the percentage of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) cases in which bystander CPR was performed, based on the study conducted in Singapore in 2019?","When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.

Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

"What is the percentage of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) cases in which bystander CPR was performed, based on the study conducted in Singapore in 2019?","INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.  Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.",0.0,,,,,,

"What is the percentage of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) cases in which bystander CPR was performed, based on the study conducted in Singapore in 2019?","When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",0.0,,,,,,

"What is the percentage of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) cases in which bystander CPR was performed, based on the study conducted in Singapore in 2019?","3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",0.0,,,,,,

Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up.

Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest.

The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8.

If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0.0,,,,,,

When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.

"What is the primary factor that maximizes survival from sudden death, according to the text?","When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.

"What is the primary factor that maximizes survival from sudden death, according to the text?","5.3: RELIEF OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO) Techniques used to relieve Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) include the Heimlich Manoeuvre (abdominal thrusts) and chest thrusts for pregnant and obese casualties. The Heimlich Manoeuvre, also known as the sub-diaphragmatic abdominal thrusts or abdominal thrusts is recommended for the relief of Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) in responsive adults (aged > 12 years) and children (aged 1 – 12 years). The Heimlich Manoeuvre elevates the diaphragm and increase airway pressure, which forces air out from the lungs. This creates an artificial cough which can expel the foreign body from the airway. In obese or pregnant casualties, chest thrusts should be used instead of abdominal thrusts.",0.0,,,,,,

"What is the primary factor that maximizes survival from sudden death, according to the text?","INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.  Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.",1.0,,,,,,

"What is the primary factor that maximizes survival from sudden death, according to the text?","When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.

"What is the primary factor that maximizes survival from sudden death, according to the text?","3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",1.0,,,,,,

They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.

Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.

"What is the primary factor that maximizes survival from sudden death, according to the text?","3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8.

If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.

"What is the primary factor that maximizes survival from sudden death, according to the text?","6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. ",0.0,,,,,,

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.

When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.

What is the minimum requirement for performing basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs)?,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%. School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.",1.0,,,,,,

When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose.

Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.

What is the minimum requirement for performing basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs)?,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",1.0,,,,,,

What is the minimum requirement for performing basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs)?,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",1.0,,,,,,

They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up.

Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest.

The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8.

The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.   Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.  - If the casualty is sitting, the rescuer kneels  and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.    Step 3: Location of landmark   - Place your arms under the casualty’s armpits encircling the chest.  - Make a fist with one hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place thumb-side of fist on the middle of the casualty’s sternum (breastbone).   Step 4: Chest thrusts   - Grasp your fist with your other hand and bring yourself close to the casualty before giving quick backward thrusts .  - Deliver each backward thrust firmly and distinctly. Perform  continuous backward chest thrusts with the intent of relieving the obstruction until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.      5.6: RELIEF OF UNCONSCIOUS ADULT/CHILD  FBAO   If the casualty becomes unconscious, proceed with the following steps.  Step 1: Position the casualty   - Support and position the casualty lying on his/her back on a firm flat surface .  Step 2: Activate the Emergency Medical Service (EMS)   - Rescuer shouts: “Help! Call ambulance 995  and get an AED !” However, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.   Step 3: Start 30 chest compressions   Locate the landmark and perform 30 chest compressions using the same location and techniques used for chest compressions in CPR.

Take care not to force the foreign body deeper into the throat. This manoeuvre is known as the finger sweep .  Note:   - Do not perform blind finger sweep. Blind finger sweep may push the object back or further into the airway.   - However, if there are no objects found in the mouth, repeat steps 3 and 4 until object has been removed.   - For lay rescuers – Once object has been removed, check for breathing. If breathing is absent, repeat steps 3 and 4 until breathing resumes or emergency help arrives.  For trained healthcare providers – See step 5. ",1.0,,,,,,

If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.    - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.   - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.    Note:   1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.   2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions.

What is the minimum requirement for performing basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs)?,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

What is the minimum requirement for performing basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs)?,"(C) Chest Compressions   - Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

What is the primary function of the heart in the human body?,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs).

Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%. School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.",0.0,What is the primary function of the heart in the human body?,,,,,
,"Recommendation for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Use in Children  The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) advocates early use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) on children to analyse rhythms and provide defibrillation in cases of cardiac arrest with shockable rhythms. When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose. If a paediatric dose-attenuating system is unavailable, then a standard Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be used.",0.0,What is the primary function of the heart in the human body?,,,,,

,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.

,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.

,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",1.0,What is the primary function of the heart in the human body?,,,,,
,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",1.0,What is the primary function of the heart in the human body?,,,,,
,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",0.0,What is the primary function of the heart in the human body?,,,,,

Steps for Applying Automated External Defibrillator Pads: (1)Open the packet containing Automated External Defibrillator pads with cable and connector. (2)Peel off the protective backing from the pads. (3)Follow the pictures on the pads to determine their correct location on the chest. (4)Press the pads firmly onto the chest wall.

,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9.

Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

,"(C) Chest Compressions   - Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands.

,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.  Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ",0.0,Which side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and delivers it to the vital organs?,,,,,
,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops. Heart will soon stop beating. 4-6 minutes: Brain damage possible. 6-10 minutes: Brain damage likely.

,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival.

,"1.7: THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL The essential steps for helping a cardiac arrest victim are illustrated in a system called the “Chain of Survival”. The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%.

It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose.

,"5.3: RELIEF OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO) Techniques used to relieve Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) include the Heimlich Manoeuvre (abdominal thrusts) and chest thrusts for pregnant and obese casualties. The Heimlich Manoeuvre, also known as the sub-diaphragmatic abdominal thrusts or abdominal thrusts is recommended for the relief of Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) in responsive adults (aged > 12 years) and children (aged 1 – 12 years). The Heimlich Manoeuvre elevates the diaphragm and increase airway pressure, which forces air out from the lungs. This creates an artificial cough which can expel the foreign body from the airway.

,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.  Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.",0.0,Which side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and delivers it to the vital organs?,,,,,

,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.

,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.  Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation.

,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops.

,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival.

,"1.7: THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL The essential steps for helping a cardiac arrest victim are illustrated in a system called the “Chain of Survival”. The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%. School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.",,,Which side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and delivers it to the vital organs?,0.0,,,
,"Recommendation for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Use in Children  The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) advocates early use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) on children to analyse rhythms and provide defibrillation in cases of cardiac arrest with shockable rhythms. When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose. If a paediatric dose-attenuating system is unavailable, then a standard Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be used.",,,Which side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and delivers it to the vital organs?,0.0,,,

,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.

,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.

,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",,,Which side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and delivers it to the vital organs?,0.0,,,
,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",,,Which side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and delivers it to the vital organs?,0.0,,,
,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",,,Which side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and delivers it to the vital organs?,0.0,,,

Steps for Applying Automated External Defibrillator Pads: (1)Open the packet containing Automated External Defibrillator pads with cable and connector. (2)Peel off the protective backing from the pads. (3)Follow the pictures on the pads to determine their correct location on the chest. (4)Press the pads firmly onto the chest wall. (5)Stand clear when the Automated External Defibrillator is analyzing the heart rhythm. (6)Stand clear when pressing the button to deliver the shock.

,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9.

,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands.

,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.  Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation.

,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops. Heart will soon stop beating. 4-6 minutes: Brain damage possible. 6-10 minutes: Brain damage likely.

,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival.

,"1.7: THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL The essential steps for helping a cardiac arrest victim are illustrated in a system called the “Chain of Survival”. The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%.

It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose.

If the casualty is wheezing (breathing noisily with a wheezing sound) or coughing, this means that the airway is partially obstructed. Do not interfere. Allow the casualty to cough to expel the object himself/herself. In complete airway obstruction, the casualty is unable to speak, breathe or cough and may become cyanotic (blue).

,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.

,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.

,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",,,What is the name of the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the left side of the heart?,0.0,,,
,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).

If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",,,What is the name of the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the left side of the heart?,0.0,,,

,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9. Throughout this period, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should remain connected to the casualty.",,,What is the name of the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the left side of the heart?,0.0,,,

,"5.4: HEIMLICH MAN OEUVRE  Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” . If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.   Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.  - If the casualty is sitting, the rescuer kneels  and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.    Step 3: Location of landmark   - Place your arms under the casualty’s armpits encircling the chest.  - Make a fist with one hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place thumb-side of fist on the middle of the casualty’s sternum (breastbone).   Step 4: Chest thrusts   - Grasp your fist with your other hand and bring yourself close to the casualty before giving quick backward thrusts .  - Deliver each backward thrust firmly and distinctly. Perform  continuous backward chest thrusts with the intent of relieving the obstruction until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.      5.6: RELIEF OF UNCONSCIOUS ADULT/CHILD  FBAO   If the casualty becomes unconscious, proceed with the following steps.  Step 1: Position the casualty   - Support and position the casualty lying on his/her back on a firm flat surface .  Step 2: Activate the Emergency Medical Service (EMS)   - Rescuer shouts: “Help! Call ambulance 995  and get an AED !” However, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.

If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.    - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.   - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.    Note:   1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.   2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you m ay take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions).

,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs).

,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked.

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation.

,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted.

,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",,,What is the purpose of the pulmonary arteries in the circulatory system?,0.0,,,

,"1.7: THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL The essential steps for helping a cardiac arrest victim are illustrated in a system called the “Chain of Survival”. The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

,"1.8: SCDF MYRESPONDER MOBILE APPLICATION In Singapore, many of the emergency cases SCDF responds to could be quickly attended to by members of the public even before SCDF’s arrival. For example, more than 3000 people suffer from Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA), with a survival rate of just 5%, which could be improved by simple medical intervention within the first few critical minutes. At the same time, there are more than 1,000 minor fires (such as rubbish chute/bin fire) that could easily be extinguished using publicly-available means.

,"3.9: CHILD/INFANT DEFIBRILLATION Use of Automated External Defibrillator (AED) in Children  Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in children are usually from non-cardiac causes with majority of the casualties presenting with non-shockable cardiac rhythms (asystole or pulseless electrical activity).  Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%. School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.",,,What is the purpose of the pulmonary arteries in the circulatory system?,0.0,,,
,"Recommendation for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Use in Children  The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) advocates early use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) on children to analyse rhythms and provide defibrillation in cases of cardiac arrest with shockable rhythms. When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose.

(R) Check for Responsiveness  - The rescuer should tap the child’s shoulders firmly and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’ - Avoid violent shaking of the child as this may result in injury. - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.  For Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) to be effective, the casualty must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface.

,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).

,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.

,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.

,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.

Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

,"1.8: SCDF MYRESPONDER MOBILE APPLICATION In Singapore, many of the emergency cases SCDF responds to could be quickly attended to by members of the public even before SCDF’s arrival. For example, more than 3000 people suffer from Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA), with a survival rate of just 5%, which could be improved by simple medical intervention within the first few critical minutes. At the same time, there are more than 1,000 minor fires (such as rubbish chute/bin fire) that could easily be extinguished using publicly-available means.

,"3.9: CHILD/INFANT DEFIBRILLATION Use of Automated External Defibrillator (AED) in Children  Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in children are usually from non-cardiac causes with majority of the casualties presenting with non-shockable cardiac rhythms (asystole or pulseless electrical activity).  Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%. School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.",,,,0.0,What is the purpose of the pulmonary arteries in the circulatory system?,,
,"Recommendation for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Use in Children  The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) advocates early use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) on children to analyse rhythms and provide defibrillation in cases of cardiac arrest with shockable rhythms. When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose.

,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).

,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.

,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",,,,0.0,What is the purpose of the pulmonary arteries in the circulatory system?,,
,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",,,,0.0,What is the purpose of the pulmonary arteries in the circulatory system?,,
,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",,,,0.0,What is the purpose of the pulmonary arteries in the circulatory system?,,

Steps for Applying Automated External Defibrillator Pads: (1)Open the packet containing Automated External Defibrillator pads with cable and connector. (2)Peel off the protective backing from the pads. (3)Follow the pictures on the pads to determine their correct location on the chest. (4)Press the pads firmly onto the chest wall.

,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9.

,"For Trained Healthcare Providers:  Step 5: Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation   - Attempt one v entilation via BVM (1st ventilation). If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.    - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.   - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.    Note:   1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.   2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you m ay take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions).

,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands. ",,,,0.0,Which organs receive oxygen-rich blood directly from the left side of the heart?,,

,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery.

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation.

,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.

,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",,,,0.0,Which organs receive oxygen-rich blood directly from the left side of the heart?,,

,"1.7: THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL The essential steps for helping a cardiac arrest victim are illustrated in a system called the “Chain of Survival”. The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%.

It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose.

,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.

,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.

,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",,,,0.0,Which organs receive oxygen-rich blood directly from the left side of the heart?,,
,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).

,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest.

,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9. Throughout this period, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should remain connected to the casualty.",,,,0.0,Which organs receive oxygen-rich blood directly from the left side of the heart?,,

,"5.4: HEIMLICH MAN OEUVRE  Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” . If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.   Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.  - If the casualty is sitting, the rescuer kneels  and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.    Step 3: Location of landmark   - Place your arms under the casualty’s armpits encircling the chest.  - Make a fist with one hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place thumb-side of fist on the middle of the casualty’s sternum (breastbone).   Step 4: Chest thrusts   - Grasp your fist with your other hand and bring yourself close to the casualty before giving quick backward thrusts .  - Deliver each backward thrust firmly and distinctly. Perform  continuous backward chest thrusts with the intent of relieving the obstruction until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.      5.6: RELIEF OF UNCONSCIOUS ADULT/CHILD  FBAO   If the casualty becomes unconscious, proceed with the following steps.  Step 1: Position the casualty   - Support and position the casualty lying on his/her back on a firm flat surface .  Step 2: Activate the Emergency Medical Service (EMS)   - Rescuer shouts: “Help! Call ambulance 995  and get an AED !” However, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.   Step 3: Start 30 chest compressions   Locate the landmark and perform 30 chest compressions using the same location and techniques used for chest compressions in CPR.

,"For Trained Healthcare Providers:  Step 5: Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation   - Attempt one v entilation via BVM (1st ventilation). If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.    - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.   - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.    Note:   1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.   2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you m ay take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions).

,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

,"(C) Chest Compressions   - Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home.

,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B.

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation.

,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.

,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",,,,0.0,What is the primary function of the coronary arteries in relation to the heart muscles?,,

,"1.7: THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL The essential steps for helping a cardiac arrest victim are illustrated in a system called the “Chain of Survival”. The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

,"1.8: SCDF MYRESPONDER MOBILE APPLICATION In Singapore, many of the emergency cases SCDF responds to could be quickly attended to by members of the public even before SCDF’s arrival. For example, more than 3000 people suffer from Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA), with a survival rate of just 5%, which could be improved by simple medical intervention within the first few critical minutes. At the same time, there are more than 1,000 minor fires (such as rubbish chute/bin fire) that could easily be extinguished using publicly-available means.

,"3.9: CHILD/INFANT DEFIBRILLATION Use of Automated External Defibrillator (AED) in Children  Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in children are usually from non-cardiac causes with majority of the casualties presenting with non-shockable cardiac rhythms (asystole or pulseless electrical activity).  Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%. School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.",,,,0.0,What is the primary function of the coronary arteries in relation to the heart muscles?,,
,"Recommendation for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Use in Children  The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) advocates early use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) on children to analyse rhythms and provide defibrillation in cases of cardiac arrest with shockable rhythms. When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose. If a paediatric dose-attenuating system is unavailable, then a standard Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be used.",,,,0.0,What is the primary function of the coronary arteries in relation to the heart muscles?,,

(R) Check for Responsiveness  - The rescuer should tap the child’s shoulders firmly and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’ - Avoid violent shaking of the child as this may result in injury. - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.  For Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) to be effective, the casualty must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface.

,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).

,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",,,,0.0,What is the primary function of the coronary arteries in relation to the heart muscles?,,

,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",,,,0.0,What is the primary function of the coronary arteries in relation to the heart muscles?,,
,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",,,,0.0,What is the primary function of the coronary arteries in relation to the heart muscles?,,
,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest.

,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9.

Step 3: Location of landmark   - Place your arms under the casualty’s armpits encircling the chest.  - Make a fist with one hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place thumb-side of fist on the middle of the casualty’s sternum (breastbone).   Step 4: Chest thrusts   - Grasp your fist with your other hand and bring yourself close to the casualty before giving quick backward thrusts .  - Deliver each backward thrust firmly and distinctly. Perform  continuous backward chest thrusts with the intent of relieving the obstruction until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.      5.6: RELIEF OF UNCONSCIOUS ADULT/CHILD  FBAO   If the casualty becomes unconscious, proceed with the following steps.  Step 1: Position the casualty   - Support and position the casualty lying on his/her back on a firm flat surface .  Step 2: Activate the Emergency Medical Service (EMS)   - Rescuer shouts: “Help! Call ambulance 995  and get an AED !” However, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.   Step 3: Start 30 chest compressions   Locate the landmark and perform 30 chest compressions using the same location and techniques used for chest compressions in CPR.

,"Step 4: Open the airway  - Perform the Head-Tilt, Chin-lift manoeuvre  to open the airway.   - While maintaining head tilt, open the mouth gently to check for visible foreign  bodies.   - If no foreign body is seen, perform another 30 chest compressions.  - If a foreign body  is seen, maintain the open airway with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre and insert the index finger of your other hand into the casualty’s mouth along the inside of the cheek.  - Use a hooking action to dislodge the foreign body and manoeuvre it out of the mouth. Take care not to force the foreign body deeper into the throat. This manoeuvre is known as the finger sweep .  Note:   - Do not perform blind finger sweep. Blind finger sweep may push the object back or further into the airway.   - However, if there are no objects found in the mouth, repeat steps 3 and 4 until object has been removed.   - For lay rescuers – Once object has been removed, check for breathing. If breathing is absent, repeat steps 3 and 4 until breathing resumes or emergency help arrives.  For trained healthcare providers – See step 5.

,"For Trained Healthcare Providers:  Step 5: Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation   - Attempt one v entilation via BVM (1st ventilation). If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.    - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.   - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.    Note:   1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.   2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you m ay take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions).

,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

,"(C) Chest Compressions   - Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands.

,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.  Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation.

,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops.

,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival.

,"1.7: THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL The essential steps for helping a cardiac arrest victim are illustrated in a system called the “Chain of Survival”. The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%.

,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.  Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.",,,,0.0,What is the name of the node that initiates the electrical signals that regulate the pumping action of the heart?,,

,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.

Although chest compressions are commonly performed by kneeling at the side of the casualty, there may be specific circumstances involving narrow alleys, walkways or corridors where the rescuer may have to perform chest compressions by positioning over the head instead of the usual lateral side.  2.17 – Overhead CPR In the case of a passenger aircraft, a rescuer should kneel in the leg-space in front of the aisle seats to perform chest compressions if the casualty cannot be transferred within a few seconds to an area with adequate floor space such as the galley",,,,0.0,What is the name of the node that initiates the electrical signals that regulate the pumping action of the heart?,,
,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",,,,0.0,What is the name of the node that initiates the electrical signals that regulate the pumping action of the heart?,,
,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions.

,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",,,,0.0,What is the name of the node that initiates the electrical signals that regulate the pumping action of the heart?,,

Steps for Applying Automated External Defibrillator Pads: (1)Open the packet containing Automated External Defibrillator pads with cable and connector. (2)Peel off the protective backing from the pads. (3)Follow the pictures on the pads to determine their correct location on the chest. (4)Press the pads firmly onto the chest wall. (5)Stand clear when the Automated External Defibrillator is analyzing the heart rhythm. (6)Stand clear when pressing the button to deliver the shock.

,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9. Throughout this period, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should remain connected to the casualty.",,,,0.0,What is the name of the node that initiates the electrical signals that regulate the pumping action of the heart?,,

,"5.4: HEIMLICH MAN OEUVRE  Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” . If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.

An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.   - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.    Note:   1.

,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home.

,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.  Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation.

,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops.

,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",,,,0.0,What is the normal range of heartbeats per minute in a healthy individual?,,

,"1.7: THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL The essential steps for helping a cardiac arrest victim are illustrated in a system called the “Chain of Survival”. The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%.

,"Recommendation for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Use in Children  The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) advocates early use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) on children to analyse rhythms and provide defibrillation in cases of cardiac arrest with shockable rhythms. When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose.

,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.

,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.

,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",,,,0.0,What is the normal range of heartbeats per minute in a healthy individual?,,
,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.

,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest.

,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8.

,"5.4: HEIMLICH MAN OEUVRE  Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” . If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.   Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.  - If the casualty is sitting, the rescuer kneels  and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.    Step 3: Location of landmark   - Place your arms under the casualty’s armpits encircling the chest.  - Make a fist with one hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place thumb-side of fist on the middle of the casualty’s sternum (breastbone).   Step 4: Chest thrusts   - Grasp your fist with your other hand and bring yourself close to the casualty before giving quick backward thrusts .  - Deliver each backward thrust firmly and distinctly. Perform  continuous backward chest thrusts with the intent of relieving the obstruction until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.      5.6: RELIEF OF UNCONSCIOUS ADULT/CHILD  FBAO   If the casualty becomes unconscious, proceed with the following steps.  Step 1: Position the casualty   - Support and position the casualty lying on his/her back on a firm flat surface .  Step 2: Activate the Emergency Medical Service (EMS)   - Rescuer shouts: “Help! Call ambulance 995  and get an AED !” However, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.   Step 3: Start 30 chest compressions   Locate the landmark and perform 30 chest compressions using the same location and techniques used for chest compressions in CPR.

If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.    - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.   - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.    Note:   1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.   2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you m ay take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions).

,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

,"(C) Chest Compressions   - Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs).

,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery.

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation.

,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.

,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",,,,0.0,What medical device is used to detect and record the electrical signals of the heart?,,

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%.

It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose.

,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.  Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.",,,,0.0,What medical device is used to detect and record the electrical signals of the heart?,,

,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.

,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",,,,1.0,What medical device is used to detect and record the electrical signals of the heart?,,
,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",,,,1.0,What medical device is used to detect and record the electrical signals of the heart?,,
,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",,,,0.0,What medical device is used to detect and record the electrical signals of the heart?,,

Steps for Applying Automated External Defibrillator Pads: (1)Open the packet containing Automated External Defibrillator pads with cable and connector. (2)Peel off the protective backing from the pads. (3)Follow the pictures on the pads to determine their correct location on the chest. (4)Press the pads firmly onto the chest wall.

,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9. Throughout this period, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should remain connected to the casualty.",,,,1.0,What medical device is used to detect and record the electrical signals of the heart?,,

Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.

,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands.

,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B.

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation.

,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.

,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. ",,,,0.0,What is the term for the organized heartbeat that occurs at a regular rate in a normal person?,,

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%.

,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.  Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.",,,,0.0,What is the term for the organized heartbeat that occurs at a regular rate in a normal person?,,
,"Assessing severity: 1. Mild: Partial Airway Obstruction (Able to produce sound, breathe, or cough) Do not interfere: Allow the casualty to clear the airway by coughing. Continue to check for deterioration (inability to produce sound, breathe, or cough) or until obstruction is relieved. Consider calling 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS if repeated attempts by the casualty are not successful.

,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",,,,0.0,What is the term for the organized heartbeat that occurs at a regular rate in a normal person?,,

,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",,,,0.0,What is the term for the organized heartbeat that occurs at a regular rate in a normal person?,,
,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",,,,0.0,What is the term for the organized heartbeat that occurs at a regular rate in a normal person?,,
,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",,,,0.0,What is the term for the organized heartbeat that occurs at a regular rate in a normal person?,,

Steps for Applying Automated External Defibrillator Pads: (1)Open the packet containing Automated External Defibrillator pads with cable and connector. (2)Peel off the protective backing from the pads. (3)Follow the pictures on the pads to determine their correct location on the chest. (4)Press the pads firmly onto the chest wall.

,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9.

,"5.4: HEIMLICH MAN OEUVRE  Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” . If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.   Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.  - If the casualty is sitting, the rescuer kneels  and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.    Step 3: Location of landmark   - Place your arms under the casualty’s armpits encircling the chest.  - Make a fist with one hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place thumb-side of fist on the middle of the casualty’s sternum (breastbone).   Step 4: Chest thrusts   - Grasp your fist with your other hand and bring yourself close to the casualty before giving quick backward thrusts .  - Deliver each backward thrust firmly and distinctly. Perform  continuous backward chest thrusts with the intent of relieving the obstruction until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.      5.6: RELIEF OF UNCONSCIOUS ADULT/CHILD  FBAO   If the casualty becomes unconscious, proceed with the following steps.  Step 1: Position the casualty   - Support and position the casualty lying on his/her back on a firm flat surface .  Step 2: Activate the Emergency Medical Service (EMS)   - Rescuer shouts: “Help! Call ambulance 995  and get an AED !” However, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.   Step 3: Start 30 chest compressions   Locate the landmark and perform 30 chest compressions using the same location and techniques used for chest compressions in CPR.

If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.    - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.   - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.    Note:   1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.   2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you m ay take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions).

,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

,"(C) Chest Compressions   - Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands.

,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.  Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation.

,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops.

,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival.

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.  Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation.

,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops.

,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival.

First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.

,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.

,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",,,,0.0,,"What is the normal heart rate in beats per minute, as indicated by a normal sinus rhythm on an electrocardiogram (ECG)?",
,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions.

,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",,,,0.0,,"What is the normal heart rate in beats per minute, as indicated by a normal sinus rhythm on an electrocardiogram (ECG)?",

Steps for Applying Automated External Defibrillator Pads: (1)Open the packet containing Automated External Defibrillator pads with cable and connector. (2)Peel off the protective backing from the pads. (3)Follow the pictures on the pads to determine their correct location on the chest. (4)Press the pads firmly onto the chest wall. (5)Stand clear when the Automated External Defibrillator is analyzing the heart rhythm. (6)Stand clear when pressing the button to deliver the shock.

,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9.

If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing.

,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest).

,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands.

,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.  Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation.

,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.

,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival.

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%.

If the casualty is wheezing (breathing noisily with a wheezing sound) or coughing, this means that the airway is partially obstructed. Do not interfere. Allow the casualty to cough to expel the object himself/herself. In complete airway obstruction, the casualty is unable to speak, breathe or cough and may become cyanotic (blue).

,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.  Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.",,,,0.0,,,"What percentage of oxygen is extracted from the air breathed in by the lungs, and what is the significance of this in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation?"

,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.

,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.

Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",,,,0.0,,,"What percentage of oxygen is extracted from the air breathed in by the lungs, and what is the significance of this in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation?"
,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions.

,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",,,,0.0,,,"What percentage of oxygen is extracted from the air breathed in by the lungs, and what is the significance of this in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation?"

,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9. Throughout this period, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should remain connected to the casualty.",,,,0.0,,,"What percentage of oxygen is extracted from the air breathed in by the lungs, and what is the significance of this in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation?"

,"5.4: HEIMLICH MAN OEUVRE  Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” . If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.

An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.   - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.    Note:   1.

,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home.

,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.  Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation.

,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops. Heart will soon stop beating. 4-6 minutes: Brain damage possible. 6-10 minutes: Brain damage likely. Over 10 minutes: Irreversible brain damage certain.",,,,0.0,,,"How many large squares on an ECG represent 1 second, and what is the significance of this in measuring heart rate?"
,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival.

,"1.7: THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL The essential steps for helping a cardiac arrest victim are illustrated in a system called the “Chain of Survival”. The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

,"3.9: CHILD/INFANT DEFIBRILLATION Use of Automated External Defibrillator (AED) in Children  Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in children are usually from non-cardiac causes with majority of the casualties presenting with non-shockable cardiac rhythms (asystole or pulseless electrical activity).  Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%. School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.",,,,0.0,,,"How many large squares on an ECG represent 1 second, and what is the significance of this in measuring heart rate?"
,"Recommendation for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Use in Children  The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) advocates early use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) on children to analyse rhythms and provide defibrillation in cases of cardiac arrest with shockable rhythms. When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose.

,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).

,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.

,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",,,,0.0,,,"How many large squares on an ECG represent 1 second, and what is the significance of this in measuring heart rate?"
,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).

,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest.

,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9.

,"5.4: HEIMLICH MAN OEUVRE  Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” . If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.   Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.  - If the casualty is sitting, the rescuer kneels  and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.    Step 3: Location of landmark   - Place your arms under the casualty’s armpits encircling the chest.  - Make a fist with one hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place thumb-side of fist on the middle of the casualty’s sternum (breastbone).   Step 4: Chest thrusts   - Grasp your fist with your other hand and bring yourself close to the casualty before giving quick backward thrusts .  - Deliver each backward thrust firmly and distinctly. Perform  continuous backward chest thrusts with the intent of relieving the obstruction until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.      5.6: RELIEF OF UNCONSCIOUS ADULT/CHILD  FBAO   If the casualty becomes unconscious, proceed with the following steps.  Step 1: Position the casualty   - Support and position the casualty lying on his/her back on a firm flat surface .  Step 2: Activate the Emergency Medical Service (EMS)   - Rescuer shouts: “Help! Call ambulance 995  and get an AED !” However, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.   Step 3: Start 30 chest compressions   Locate the landmark and perform 30 chest compressions using the same location and techniques used for chest compressions in CPR.

,"Step 4: Open the airway  - Perform the Head-Tilt, Chin-lift manoeuvre  to open the airway.   - While maintaining head tilt, open the mouth gently to check for visible foreign  bodies.   - If no foreign body is seen, perform another 30 chest compressions.  - If a foreign body  is seen, maintain the open airway with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre and insert the index finger of your other hand into the casualty’s mouth along the inside of the cheek.  - Use a hooking action to dislodge the foreign body and manoeuvre it out of the mouth. Take care not to force the foreign body deeper into the throat. This manoeuvre is known as the finger sweep .  Note:   - Do not perform blind finger sweep. Blind finger sweep may push the object back or further into the airway.   - However, if there are no objects found in the mouth, repeat steps 3 and 4 until object has been removed.   - For lay rescuers – Once object has been removed, check for breathing. If breathing is absent, repeat steps 3 and 4 until breathing resumes or emergency help arrives.  For trained healthcare providers – See step 5.

If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.    - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.   - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.    Note:   1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.   2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you m ay take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions).

,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

,"(C) Chest Compressions   - Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.

,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands.

,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery.

Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation.

,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.

,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival.

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.

,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.

,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",,,,0.0,,,What is the pathway by which oxygenated blood is transported from the lungs to the left side of the heart?
,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  (f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. ",,,,0.0,,,What is the pathway by which oxygenated blood is transported from the lungs to the left side of the heart?
,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest.

,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.  9.

Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing.

,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.

,"Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality.  A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions.  Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands.

,"1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are:  Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether. Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed.  Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed.  Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed.  Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

,"1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK? A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack.   Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery: description: This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B. Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked. Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows: Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.  Symptoms of a Heart Attack  A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these:  Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue.  Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack.  Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness  If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation.

,"1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST? When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases. When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally.  Biological death and Clinical death   Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes  description: 0 minutes: Breathing stops.

,"When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the  circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible. Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain.  Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival.

The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.  First Ring: Prevention  Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles.  Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access  Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions.  Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart.  Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate.  Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance)  Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.  Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators).  Seventh Ring: Recovery  To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy.

Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation.  However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%.

The Heimlich Manoeuvre, also known as the sub-diaphragmatic abdominal thrusts or abdominal thrusts is recommended for the relief of Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) in responsive adults (aged > 12 years) and children (aged 1 – 12 years). The Heimlich Manoeuvre elevates the diaphragm and increase airway pressure, which forces air out from the lungs. This creates an artificial cough which can expel the foreign body from the airway. In obese or pregnant casualties, chest thrusts should be used instead of abdominal thrusts.",,,,0.0,,,"What percentage of air consists of oxygen, and what happens to the remaining unabsorbed oxygen in the context of breathing?"

,"INTRODUCTION:  Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing.  In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts.  Precautions:  -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between.  -Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant.   -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.  -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating.   RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)  Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound).  If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup.  Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.",,,,0.0,,,"What percentage of air consists of oxygen, and what happens to the remaining unabsorbed oxygen in the context of breathing?"
,"Assessing severity: 1. Mild: Partial Airway Obstruction (Able to produce sound, breathe, or cough) Do not interfere: Allow the casualty to clear the airway by coughing. Continue to check for deterioration (inability to produce sound, breathe, or cough) or until obstruction is relieved. Consider calling 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS if repeated attempts by the casualty are not successful. Note: Avoid feeding the casualty water/food and do not shake the casualty in an attempt to dislodge the foreign body.",,,,0.0,,,"What percentage of air consists of oxygen, and what happens to the remaining unabsorbed oxygen in the context of breathing?"

,"When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.",,,,0.0,,,"What percentage of air consists of oxygen, and what happens to the remaining unabsorbed oxygen in the context of breathing?"

,"3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation: At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable).  During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.  Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.",,,,0.0,,,"What percentage of air consists of oxygen, and what happens to the remaining unabsorbed oxygen in the context of breathing?"
,"3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs): Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following:  (a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart.  (b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked.  (c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level.  (d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads.  (e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).

,"3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following:  Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer.  Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel.  Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator. Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads:  (1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing.  (2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this.  (3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall.  (4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices.  (5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement.  (6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.",,,,0.0,,,"What percentage of air consists of oxygen, and what happens to the remaining unabsorbed oxygen in the context of breathing?"

,"3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES  1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing.  2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”.  3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase. 4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it.  5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.”  6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.  7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.  8.

,"5.4: HEIMLICH MAN OEUVRE  Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” . If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.   Note:  - If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.   - If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.     Step 3: Locate the  landmark   - Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.   - Locate the navel.   - Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process.  - Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.     Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre   - Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen.  - Grasp your fist with your other hand.   - Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.   - Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.    Note:   - Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.      The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre   - To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.   - If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.      5.5: CHEST THRUSTS   This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.   Step 1: Assessment   - Ask: “Are you choking?” If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.    Step 2: Position of rescuer   - If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.  - If the casualty is sitting, the rescuer kneels  and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.    Step 3: Location of landmark   - Place your arms under the casualty’s armpits encircling the chest.  - Make a fist with one hand with the thumb in the palm.   - Place thumb-side of fist on the middle of the casualty’s sternum (breastbone).   Step 4: Chest thrusts   - Grasp your fist with your other hand and bring yourself close to the casualty before giving quick backward thrusts .  - Deliver each backward thrust firmly and distinctly. Perform  continuous backward chest thrusts with the intent of relieving the obstruction until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.      5.6: RELIEF OF UNCONSCIOUS ADULT/CHILD  FBAO   If the casualty becomes unconscious, proceed with the following steps.  Step 1: Position the casualty   - Support and position the casualty lying on his/her back on a firm flat surface .  Step 2: Activate the Emergency Medical Service (EMS)   - Rescuer shouts: “Help! Call ambulance 995  and get an AED !” However, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.   Step 3: Start 30 chest compressions   Locate the landmark and perform 30 chest compressions using the same location and techniques used for chest compressions in CPR.

,"Step 4: Open the airway  - Perform the Head-Tilt, Chin-lift manoeuvre  to open the airway.   - While maintaining head tilt, open the mouth gently to check for visible foreign  bodies.   - If no foreign body is seen, perform another 30 chest compressions.  - If a foreign body  is seen, maintain the open airway with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre and insert the index finger of your other hand into the casualty’s mouth along the inside of the cheek.  - Use a hooking action to dislodge the foreign body and manoeuvre it out of the mouth. Take care not to force the foreign body deeper into the throat. This manoeuvre is known as the finger sweep .  Note:   - Do not perform blind finger sweep. Blind finger sweep may push the object back or further into the airway.   - However, if there are no objects found in the mouth, repeat steps 3 and 4 until object has been removed.   - For lay rescuers – Once object has been removed, check for breathing. If breathing is absent, repeat steps 3 and 4 until breathing resumes or emergency help arrives.  For trained healthcare providers – See step 5.

,"For Trained Healthcare Providers:  Step 5: Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation   - Attempt one v entilation via BVM (1st ventilation). If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.    - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.   - Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.    - Release the nose after each breath.   - If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.   - If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.   - Check for normal breathing and pulse.   - If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR.  - If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.   - If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.    Note:   1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.   2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you m ay take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions).

,"6.1: INFANT CPR     This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.   Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.    (D) Check for Danger   Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.     (R) Check for Responsiveness   - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’. - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.    - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.      For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.    (S) Shout to get help   If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.   - In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.    (A) Ask someone to get an AED  - Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.   (B) Check for normal Breathing   - Look for the rise and fall of the chest  - Do not take more than 10 seconds.   - It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.     For trained healthcare providers only   - Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.   - Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing .  - Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.   - If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.

,"(C) Chest Compressions   - Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:       - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line      between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.        - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next      to your index finger on the center of      the infant’s chest.            - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and      ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest      compressions  using the pulp of the fingers.        - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm).      - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.       - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.
