        "Question": "What percentage of oxygen is extracted from the air breathed in by the lungs, and what is the significance of this in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation?",
        "Answer": "The lungs extract 5% of oxygen from the air breathed in, which is significant in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation because it means that the air ventilated into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life. This is possible because the rescuer's exhaled breath still contains a significant amount of oxygen, which can be utilized by the casualty."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How many large squares on an ECG represent 1 second, and what is the significance of this in measuring heart rate?",
        "Answer": "Five large squares on an ECG represent 1 second, which is significant in measuring heart rate because it allows for the calculation of the heart rate in beats per minute. By counting the number of large intervals and dividing into 300 squares between 2 RR intervals, the heart rate can be determined."

    {
        "Question": "What is the primary reason why smoking increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold?",
        "Answer": "The primary reason why smoking increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold is that it promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries. This is because smoking damages the inner lining of the coronary arteries, leading to the formation of plaques, which can eventually block the flow of blood to the heart, causing a heart attack."

    {
        "Question": "A patient with high blood pressure is advised to reduce salt in their diet. What is the underlying physiological mechanism that contributes to the development of heart attack in this scenario?",
        "Answer": "When a patient with high blood pressure consumes a diet high in salt, it can lead to an increase in blood volume, which in turn increases the blood pressure. This puts additional stress on the heart, causing it to work harder to pump blood. Over time, this can lead to the development of heart attack. Therefore, reducing salt in the diet is essential to decrease the blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart attack."

        "Question": "A nurse is educating a patient with diabetes on how to manage their blood sugar levels. What lifestyle modification would the nurse recommend to decrease the risk of heart disease?",
        "Answer": "The nurse would recommend a lifestyle modification of avoiding a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and controlling body weight through diet and exercise. This is because a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars can lead to an increase in blood sugar levels, which can contribute to the development of heart disease. By controlling body weight and blood sugar levels, the patient can decrease their risk of heart disease."

    {
        "Question": "What is the primary benefit of regular exercise in managing blood lipids, and how does it reduce the risk of heart attack?",
        "Answer": "The primary benefit of regular exercise in managing blood lipids is that it can improve the blood lipid profile by increasing the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, also known as good cholesterol, and decreasing the levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, also known as bad cholesterol. Regular exercise can also reduce the risk of heart attack by improving blood flow, reducing blood pressure, and improving overall cardiovascular health."

    {
        "Question": "A patient is advised to adopt healthy lifestyles to decrease the risk of heart disease. What are the three key lifestyle modifications that the nurse would recommend to the patient?",
        "Answer": "The three key lifestyle modifications that the nurse would recommend to the patient to decrease the risk of heart disease are: not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts, and regular exercise. These lifestyle modifications can help to reduce the risk of heart disease by controlling the risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar levels, and high blood lipids, and promoting overall cardiovascular health."

        "Question": "What is the primary cause of heart muscle death during a heart attack?",
        "Answer": {
            "What is the primary cause of heart muscle death during a heart attack?": "The primary cause of heart muscle death during a heart attack is the lack of oxygenated blood supply to the heart muscle due to a blocked coronary artery. This blockage is caused by cholesterol deposits and/or blood clots, which impede blood flow to the heart muscle, leading to tissue death."

        "Question": "What is the likely outcome if a patient's heart stops beating and breathing normally due to Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and no medical intervention is provided within 10 minutes?",
        "Answer": "If a patient's heart stops beating and breathing normally due to Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and no medical intervention is provided within 10 minutes, the likely outcome is irreversible brain damage. This is because the brain is deprived of oxygen, leading to cellular death and permanent damage. In this scenario, the patient's chances of survival are extremely low, and even if they do survive, they may be left with severe neurological deficits."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the term used to describe the irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm that develops in the heart when a portion of the heart muscles dies?",
        "Answer": "The term used to describe the irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm that develops in the heart when a portion of the heart muscles dies is Ventricular Fibrillation (VF). This rhythm is life-threatening and can lead to cardiac arrest if not treated promptly."
    },
    {
        "Question": "A patient has stopped breathing and their heart has stopped beating. How long does the nurse have to restore blood circulation and breathing to prevent likely brain damage?",
        "Answer": "If a patient has stopped breathing and their heart has stopped beating, the nurse has a critical window of 4-6 minutes to restore blood circulation and breathing to prevent likely brain damage. This is because brain damage is possible within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest, and the longer the delay in restoring circulation, the higher the risk of permanent brain damage."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the term used to describe the state when the heart does not pump blood to the rest of the body due to an irregular electrical rhythm?",
        "Answer": "The term used to describe the state when the heart does not pump blood to the rest of the body due to an irregular electrical rhythm is cardiac arrest. This is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate medical attention, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation if necessary."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the critical time frame beyond which irreversible brain damage is certain if a patient's heart has stopped beating and breathing normally?",
        "Answer": "The critical time frame beyond which irreversible brain damage is certain if a patient's heart has stopped beating and breathing normally is 10 minutes. After this time, the brain has been deprived of oxygen for too long, leading to cellular death and permanent damage. Therefore, it is essential to restore blood circulation and breathing as quickly as possible to prevent this outcome."
