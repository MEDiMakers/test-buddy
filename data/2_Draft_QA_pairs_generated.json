    {
        "Question": "What is the correct hand position for chest compressions in an infant, and what is the recommended depth and rate of compression?",
        "Answer": "The correct hand position for chest compressions in an infant is to use the middle and ring fingers next to the index finger on the center of the infant's chest, with the index finger drawing an imaginary line between the nipples to the centre of the sternum. The recommended depth of compression is 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant's chest (about 3 to 4 cm), and the compression rate is 100–120 per minute, with complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What should a trained healthcare provider do to check for normal breathing and pulse in an infant, and what is the time limit for this assessment?",
        "Answer": "A trained healthcare provider should locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant's elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers, and check for normal breathing by looking for the rise and fall of the chest. This assessment should not take more than 10 seconds. If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing at the end of 10 seconds, the provider should assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions."

        "Question": "What are the characteristic signs and symptoms of foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO) in an infant, and how do they differ from those of epiglottitis and croup?",
        "Answer": "The characteristic signs and symptoms of foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO) in an infant include coughing, gagging, or stridor (a high-pitched, inspiratory noisy sound). These signs and symptoms differ from those of epiglottitis and croup, which are typically associated with an infection, such as fever, nasal congestion, and voice hoarseness. In cases of epiglottitis and croup, the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction, and immediate hospitalization is necessary."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the recommended first response to a conscious infant with a complete airway obstruction, and when should back blows and chest thrusts not be used?",
        "Answer": "The recommended first response to a conscious infant with a complete airway obstruction is to use back blows and chest thrusts to clear the obstructed airway. However, back blows and chest thrusts should not be used if the infant has an infection, such as epiglottitis or croup, as these conditions require immediate hospitalization and may not be relieved by the back blows and chest thrusts technique."

    {
        "Question": "What is the critical action to take if an infant has an infection and is suspected of having epiglottitis or croup, and why is this action necessary?",
        "Answer": "If an infant has an infection and is suspected of having epiglottitis or croup, the critical action to take is to bring the infant immediately to a hospital. This action is necessary because epiglottitis and croup are life-threatening conditions that require prompt medical attention. The back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction in these cases, and immediate hospitalization is essential to prevent serious complications or even death."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the recommended action when a casualty with a partial airway obstruction is able to produce sound, breathe, or cough?",
        "Answer": "When a casualty with a partial airway obstruction is able to produce sound, breathe, or cough, the recommended action is to not interfere and allow the casualty to clear the airway by coughing. Continue to check for deterioration, such as inability to produce sound, breathe, or cough, or until the obstruction is relieved."

    {
        "Question": "What should you do if a foreign body is seen in the infant's mouth during choking relief, and what is the name of the manoeuvre used to dislodge the foreign body?",
        "Answer": "If a foreign body is seen in the infant's mouth during choking relief, the rescuer should place the infant on a firm flat surface and remove the foreign body with their little finger using a hooking action, known as the finger sweep. This manoeuvre is used to dislodge the foreign body from the infant's mouth without pushing it further into the airway."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why is it important not to perform a blind finger sweep during infant choking relief, and what is the alternative action to take if no object is found in the mouth?",
        "Answer": "It is important not to perform a blind finger sweep during infant choking relief because it may push the object back or further into the airway, making the situation worse. Instead, if no object is found in the mouth, the rescuer should repeat the back blows and chest thrusts until the object has been removed. This ensures that the foreign object is dislodged and removed from the infant's airway, restoring breathing and preventing further complications."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the primary method of ventilation recommended in the text corpus, and what is the alternative method if the primary method is not available?",
        "Answer": "The primary method of ventilation recommended in the text corpus is Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) ventilation. If the primary method is not available, the alternative method is mouth-to-nose-and-mouth ventilation, which can be performed by a trained healthcare provider who is willing to do so. This alternative method involves sealing the lips around the casualty's nose and mouth and providing one breath by blowing steadily into the infant's mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the purpose of performing a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre during Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) ventilation, and how does it ensure effective ventilations?",
        "Answer": "The purpose of performing a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre during Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) ventilation is to ensure an open airway, which is essential for effective ventilations. This manoeuvre helps to align the casualty's head and neck in a way that allows for unobstructed airflow into the lungs. By doing so, it ensures that the ventilations are effective and that the chest rises with each breath."
    },
    {
        "Question": "If the chest does not rise during mouth-to-nose-and-mouth ventilation, what should the healthcare provider do next, and why?",
        "Answer": "If the chest does not rise during mouth-to-nose-and-mouth ventilation, the healthcare provider should reposition the infant's head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre and re-attempt to ventilate. This is because the airway may be blocked, and repositioning the head can help to clear the airway and allow for effective ventilation. The healthcare provider should repeat this process until the chest rises or until help arrives."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the rate of rescue breathing recommended in the text corpus, and how should the healthcare provider count the breaths?",
        "Answer": "The rate of rescue breathing recommended in the text corpus is 30 breaths per minute, which is equivalent to one breath every 2 seconds. To count the breaths, the healthcare provider should give one breath and count '2-a-thousand', then repeat the sequence until a total of 30 breaths are completed. This rate is crucial in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation for the casualty."
    },
    {
        "Question": "If the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving during ventilation, what should the healthcare provider do next, and why?",
        "Answer": "If the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving during ventilation, the healthcare provider should stop ventilating and monitor the casualty until help arrives. This is because the casualty is showing signs of regaining consciousness or respiratory function, and further ventilation may not be necessary. The healthcare provider should continue to monitor the casualty's vital signs and be prepared to intervene if the casualty's condition deteriorates again."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the first step in relieving an unconscious infant with a foreign body airway obstruction?",

        "Question": "If a foreign body is seen in the infant's airway, what is the next step after opening the mouth using Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift (HTCL)?",
        "Answer": "If a foreign body is seen in the infant's airway, the next step after opening the mouth using Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift (HTCL) is to remove the foreign body with a finger sweep. This should be done carefully to avoid pushing the foreign body further into the airway."
    },
    {
        "Question": "If the chest does not rise after providing one ventilation, what should the healthcare provider do next?",
        "Answer": "If the chest does not rise after providing one ventilation, the healthcare provider should re-attempt Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift (HTCL) and provide one ventilation again. If the chest still does not rise, the provider should continue the cycle of chest compressions and rechecking for a foreign body."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What should the healthcare provider do if they are unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within ten seconds?",
        "Answer": "If the healthcare provider is unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within ten seconds, they should start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). This is a critical step in ensuring the infant receives timely and appropriate care."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How many chest compressions should be performed before checking for a foreign body in the infant's airway?",
        "Answer": "The healthcare provider should perform 30 chest compressions before checking for a foreign body in the infant's airway. This is an essential step in relieving the airway obstruction and ensuring the infant's safety."
