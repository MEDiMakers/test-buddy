According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions. \nSurvival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer\u2019s two hands. \n\n* White AE, Shaidah N, Asyikin N et al.

Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are: \nSmoking \u2013 Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether.\nBlood Pressure \u2013 If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed. \nBlood Sugars \u2013 Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed. \nBlood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed. \nAdopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses.

(See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack. \n\nFigure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery:\ndescription:\nThis figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B.\nSection A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked.\nSection B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows:\nHealthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.\n\nSymptoms of a Heart Attack \nA person who has a heart attack may experience any of these: \nPain \u2013 described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue. \nShortness of breath \u2013 A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack. \nOther Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness \nIf a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest. \nLearn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. ",

The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases.\nWhen VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally. \nBiological death and Clinical death \n\nFigure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes \ndescription:\n0 minutes: Breathing stops. Heart will soon stop beating.\n4-6 minutes: Brain damage possible.\n6-10 minutes: Brain damage likely.\nOver 10 minutes: Irreversible brain damage certain.\n\nWhen cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40\u201350% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death.

However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable). \nDuring Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). \nIn the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty\u2019s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates.",

AEDs are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following: \n(a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart. \n(b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked. \n(c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level. \n(d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up.

Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%. School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.\n\nRecommendation for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Use in Children \nThe International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) advocates early use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) on children to analyse rhythms and provide defibrillation in cases of cardiac arrest with shockable rhythms. When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose.

Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing. \nIn a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts. \nPrecautions:\n -Do not \u201cforce-feed\u201d milk. Allow rest in between. \n-Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant. \n -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.\n -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating. \\n \n RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO) \nChoking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound). \nIf the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup. \nBring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction."
