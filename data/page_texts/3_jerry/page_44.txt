A recent survey of cardiac arrest responders who retrieved Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) conducted locally highlighted that a pattern of injuries exists.

The following are recommendations for retrieval of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs): 
1. Download the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) myResponder application! (See Chapter 1.8) Responders with the app have a much better chance to find the nearest defibrillator with the help of the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) map. 
2. To safely retrieve the Automated External Defibrillator (AED): 
    a. Do not use your bare hands/elbows to break the glass â€“ most injuries from retrieving occur with breaking the glass. Use personal items instead e.g. mobile phone, shoes, keys etc. to reduce the risk of injuries sustained. 
    b. Clear all glass fragments around the edges with the object used to break the glass before retrieving the key. Another common mechanism of injury is due to lacerations when reaching for the key inside.
