Jonathan SY Ng, Reuben JS Ho, JY Yu, YY Ng. Factors influencing success and safety of AED retrieval in out of hospital cardiac arrests in Singapore. Korean J Emerg Med Ser. 2022 Aug; 26(2), 97-111. The following are recommendations for retrieval of AEDs: 1. Download the SCDF myResponder application! (See Chapter 1.8) Responders with the app have a much better chance to find the nearest defibrillator with the help of the AED map. 2. To safely retrieve the AED: a. Do not use your bare hands/elbows to break the glass â€“ most injuries from retrieving occur with breaking the glass. Use personal items instead e.g. mobile phone, shoes, keys etc. to reduce the risk of injuries sustained. b. Clear all glass fragments around the edges with the object used to break the glass before retrieving the key. Another common mechanism of injury is due to lacerations when reaching for the key inside.
