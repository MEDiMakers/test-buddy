Figure 3-2 - Asystole The AED should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for SCDF ambulance, also call for an AED by instructing others nearby “Get AED”.

Similar experiences from around the world has also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early CPR is combined with early defibrillation.
