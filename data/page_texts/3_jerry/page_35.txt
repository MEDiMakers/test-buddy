 Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of AED electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing. If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. AEDs come with a shaver blade to expedite this. Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall. For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingersâ€™ breadth away from these devices. Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement. Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of AED electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions. Figure 3-4 - Things to take note of during chest preparation
