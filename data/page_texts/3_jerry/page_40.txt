The flowchart titled "Algorithm for One-Rescuer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Use of Automated External Defibrillator (AED)" provides a step-by-step guide for performing Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). Here is a detailed step-by-step flow of the chart:

1. Check for Danger (D):
Ensure the area is safe for both the rescuer and the casualty.

2. Check Responsiveness (R):
Try to get a response from the casualty.

3. Shout for Help (S):
(a) Shout "Help!"
(b) Call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) and follow the dispatcherâ€™s instructions or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest).

4. Get the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) (A):
If there is another person around, ask him/her to get the Automated External Defibrillator (AED).
If alone, do not leave the casualty.

5. Check for Normal Breathing and Pulse (B):
Look for the rise and fall of the chest (not more than 10 seconds).
If normal breathing (gasping is not normal breathing) is absent or unsure, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).
Healthcare Provider only: Check for carotid pulse as well.

6. Provide Continuous Chest Compressions (C):
Expose the chest adequately.
Perform chest compressions:
    Lower half of sternum
    Depth: 4-6 cm
    Rate: 100-120 per minute
    Allow complete chest recoil
Healthcare Provider only: After 30 chest compressions
    Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift
    Provide 2 ventilations via Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM)
    1 second per ventilation
    Tidal Volume 400-600 milliliters or chest rises

7. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Arrives:

Check for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Hazards:
    Wet surfaces
    Metallic surfaces
    Flammable gases nearby
Continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)
Turn on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED)
Ensure the chest is bare and dry
Apply pads as printed on the Automated External Defibr
