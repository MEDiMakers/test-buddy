If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand. For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand. Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child). Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse. ï‚§ If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.
