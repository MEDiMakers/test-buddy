Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm. (See figure 5-6) Figure 5-6 – Place the fist 2 fingers above the navel. Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing. (See figure 5-6) Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen. (See figure 5-7) Grasp your fist with your other hand. Figure 5-7 – Lean the casualty forward. Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen. (See figure 5-8) Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction. Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious. Figure 5-8 – Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts Note:  Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.
