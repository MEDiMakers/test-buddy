 Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest. Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions: o Use your index finger to draw an imaginary line between the nipples to the centre of the sternum. (See figure 6-5) o Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next to your index finger (see figure 6-6) on the center of the infant’s chest. o Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest compressions using the pulp of the fingers. (See figure 6-7) Figure 6-5 – Trace location Figure 6-6 – Place middle & ring fingers next to index finger Figure 6-7 – Prepare for chest compressions o Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm). o The compression rate is 100–120 per minute. o Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.
