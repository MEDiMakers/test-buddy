 Look for the rise and fall of the chest (See figure 6-3). Do not take more than 10 seconds. Figure 6-3 – Look for rise and fall of chest It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping. (See https://youtu.be/T85vd3CBs04 for video of contrast between gasping and normal breathing) For trained healthcare providers only Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers. Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing. (See figure 6-4) Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds. Figure 6-4 – Check brachial pulse and normal breathing If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.
