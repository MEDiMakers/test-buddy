1.8: SCDF MYRESPONDER MOBILE APPLICATION
In Singapore, many of the emergency cases SCDF responds to could be quickly attended to by members of the public even before SCDF’s arrival. For example, more than 3000 people suffer from Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA), with a survival rate of just 5%, which could be improved by simple medical intervention within the first few critical minutes. At the same time, there are more than 1,000 minor fires (such as rubbish chute/bin fire) that could easily be extinguished using publicly-available means. (See figure 1-16)
