The heart muscles receive oxygen rich blood via a set of coronary arteries. 
The pumping action of the heart is initiated by electrical signals from a pacemaker (sinoatrial or SA node), these signals travel to other parts of the heart in an orderly manner through a conductive network. The electrical signals from the heart can be picked up by an electrocardiogram (ECG).
The pumping action gives rise to an organized heart-beat at regular rate of 60-100 beats per minute in a normal person.
