1.7: THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL
The essential steps for helping a cardiac arrest victim are illustrated in a system called the “Chain of Survival”. The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.

First Ring: Prevention 
Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles. 

Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access 
Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions. 

Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 
The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart. 

Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation 
Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate. 

Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance) 
Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.
