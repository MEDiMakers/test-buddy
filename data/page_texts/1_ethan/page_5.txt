Figure 1-1 - The heart and lungs 
The heart is a muscular pump located in the center of the chest and slightly towards the left. (See figure 1-1) The heart has two halves. The right side receives low oxygen blood from all parts of the body through veins and pumps it to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries to pick up oxygen. (See figure 1-2) The left side receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins and delivers it to all parts of the body, including the vital organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and brain.
