Count the number of large Figure 1-4 - Normal Sinus Rhythm 1 QRS per second squares between 2 RR intervals and divide into 300 The human body has two lungs which absorb oxygen from theHeart rate = 60 per min air that is breathed in. 21% of air consists of oxygen, of which 5% is extracted by the lungs. The extracted oxygen is passed to the blood within the capillaries of the lungs. The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart. (See figure 1-5) Trachea Alveoli Figure 1-5 - Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs The remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life.
