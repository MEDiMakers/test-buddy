7.4: RELIEF OF UNCONSCIOUS INFANT Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO)
If the infant becomes unconscious, proceed with the following steps.
Step 1: Position the infant Support and position the infant lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. 
Step 2: Activate Emergency Medical Service (EMS) Rescuer shouts: “Help! Call ambulance 995 and get an Automated External Defibrillator (AED)!” However, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call for an ambulance “995” and get an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). 
Step 3: Start 30 chest compressions Locate the landmark and perform 30 chest compressions using the same location and techniques used for chest compressions in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). 
Step 4: Open the airway Perform the gentle Head-Tilt and Chin-Lift manoeuvre to open the airway. While maintaining Head-Tilt, open the mouth gently to check for visible foreign bodies. If no foreign body is seen, perform another 30 chest compressions.
