Lift up your ring (fourth) finger and deliver 5 chest thrusts over the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). (See figure 7-7) o If a foreign body is seen, place the infant on a firm flat surface and remove the foreign body with your little finger. o Repeat back blows and chest thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the infant becomes unconscious. Figure 7-7 – Deliver 5 chest thrusts Note:  Do not tip-toe when performing back blows and chest thrusts as the rescuer may lose balance and fall.  Each back blow and chest thrust should be delivered with sufficient force and with the intention of expelling the foreign body.
