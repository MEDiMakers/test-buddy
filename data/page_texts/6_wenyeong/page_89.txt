Flow chart showing the summary of Unconscious Infant Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) Relief for Healthcare Providers:

1. Safely position the unconscious casualty on a flat and firm surface.

2. Shout for Help:
   - Shout "Help!" and call 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), following the dispatcherâ€™s instructions.

3. Perform 30 chest compressions.

4. Check for Foreign Body (FB):
   - If Foreign Body (FB) is seen:
     - Open the mouth using Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift (HTCL) and check for a foreign body.
     - Remove with a finger sweep.
     - Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift (HTCL) and provide 1 ventilation.
       - If chest rises:
         - Check for normal breathing and pulse (not more than 10 seconds).
           - If pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.
           - If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within ten seconds, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).
       - If chest does not rise:
         - Re-attempt Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift (HTCL) and provide 1 ventilation again.
           - If chest rises: Follow the same steps as above.
           - If chest does not rise: Continue the cycle of chest compressions and rechecking for Foreign Body (FB).

   - If no Foreign Body (FB) is seen:
     - Check for normal breathing and pulse (not more than 10 seconds).
       - If pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.
       - If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within ten seconds, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).

Note: 
   - HTCL stands for Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift.
