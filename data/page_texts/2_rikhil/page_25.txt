 E – C hand placement – ‘E’: Using one hand, hold the mask with your middle and index finger wrapped around the connector stem of the mask. ‘C’: Extend your thumb underneath the casualty’s jaw, and pull it upward into the mask. (See figure 2-13) Figure 2-13 – ‘E-C’ hand placement While maintaining the upward traction on casualty’s jaw, press the mask downward onto the face to attain a tight mask seal. (See figure 2-14) Figure 2-14 – Maintaining the upward traction of the jaw and downward traction of the mask Perform ventilation by squeezing the bag steadily and smoothly using your other hand over 1 second. Then, release the bag to allow it to reinflate fully before providing second ventilation. Each ventilation should be enough to make the chest rise. This is approximately 400 – 600 ml of air. Do not interrupt chest compressions for more than 10 seconds to perform 2 ventilations.
