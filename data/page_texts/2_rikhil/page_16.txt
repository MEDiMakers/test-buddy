myResponder works by notifying members of the public – also known as Community First Responders (CFRs) – of cardiac arrest and fire cases within 400m of their location. myResponder will also highlight nearby AEDs that may be available to responders, and provide guided advisories in the mitigation of minor fires. CFRs can then proceed to the stated location and assist by performing CPR or applying an AED to revive the patient, mitigating minor fires using available extinguishing means, or providing further information to SCDF’s 995 Operations Centre. Response is entirely voluntary, however, volunteers are encouraged to respond, when they are available and within safe and reasonable means.

The myResponder function is also available within the SGSecure application.
