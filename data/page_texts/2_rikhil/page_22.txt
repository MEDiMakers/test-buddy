For trained healthcare providers Checking of carotid pulse and breathing should not take more than 10 seconds. Check for carotid pulse when checking for normal breathing. Slide your fingers down to the groove at the side of the neck near you (this is the location of the carotid pulse). If unsure about the presence of carotid pulse and no normal breathing, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions. (C) Chest Compressions Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). (See figures 2-6 and 2-7) o Ensure adequate exposure of the chest. o Kneel by the side of the casualty. o Place the heel of one hand on the lower half of the sternum (breastbone) and avoid the Xiphoid Process. o Place the heel of the second hand on top of the first. o Interlace the fingers of both hands and lift the fingers off the chest wall. (See figure 2-8) o Straighten both the elbows and lock them into position. o Position the shoulders directly over the casualty’s chest. Use the body weight to compress the casualty’s sternum (breastbone). o Depth of chest compression for adults must be at least 4 cm but not more than 6 cm. o The compression rate is 100–120 per minute. o Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression. (See figure 2-9) o Loud counting of the chest compressions should be encouraged: 1&2&3&4&5&, 1&2&3&4&10&,
