If pulse is present and normal breathing is absent, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand. Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths. Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse. If both the breathing and pulse are present, maintain the casualty in a supine position and continuously monitor the casualty until help arrives.
