Resuscitation training should simulate the environment that rescuers may find themselves in. For example, healthcare providers should practice resuscitation skills on manikins on a trolley bed (see figure 2-16) or stand on a step stool at the side of the trolley bed. This is to ensure the elbows can be straightened to facilitate chest compressions. Figure 2-16 – CPR on a trolley bed For resuscitation involving two or more rescuers, one rescuer can focus on chest compressions with the other handling the ventilations. Additional rescuers can be delegated with other tasks such as calling 995 for SCDF or retrieving and using the AED. Although chest compressions are commonly performed by kneeling at the side of the casualty, there may be specific circumstances involving narrow alleys, walkways or corridors where the rescuer may have to perform chest compressions by positioning over the head instead of the usual lateral side. (See figure 2-17) Figure 2-17 – Overhead CPR In the case of a passenger aircraft, a rescuer should kneel in the leg-space in front of the aisle seats to perform chest compressions if the casualty cannot be transferred within a few seconds to an area with adequate floor space such as the galley.
