When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body. Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning. For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death. CPR is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible. CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body. However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys. If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures. In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations. Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated. This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR. The next section takes you step-by-step through the procedures needed to perform CPR â€“ the basic skill needed to save lives in the event of cardiac arrest.
