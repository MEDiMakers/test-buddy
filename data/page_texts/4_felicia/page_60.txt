Techniques used to relieve FBAO include the Heimlich Manoeuvre (abdominal thrusts) and chest thrusts for pregnant and obese casualties. The Heimlich Manoeuvre, also known as the sub-diaphragmatic abdominal thrusts or abdominal thrusts is recommended for the relief of FBAO in responsive adults (aged > 12 years) and children (aged 1 â€“ 12 years). The Heimlich Manoeuvre elevates the diaphragm and increase airway pressure, which forces air out from the lungs. This creates an artificial cough which can expel the foreign body from the airway. In obese or pregnant casualties, chest thrusts should be used instead of abdominal thrusts. Complications from Heimlich Manoeuvre If performed incorrectly, it may cause injuries to the internal organs resulting in rupture or laceration of abdominal or thoracic viscera.
