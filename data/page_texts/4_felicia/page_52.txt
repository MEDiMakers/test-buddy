 Look for the rise and fall of the chest (see figure 4-4). Do not take more than 10 seconds. Figure 4-4 – Look for normal breathing It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you are unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping. (See https://youtu.be/T85vd3CBs04 for video of contrast between gasping and normal breathing) For trained healthcare providers Checking of carotid pulse and breathing (not more than 10 seconds) should be done. Check for carotid pulse when checking for normal breathing. Slide your fingers down to the groove at the side of the neck near you (this is the location of the carotid pulse). (See figure 4-5) Figure 4-5 – Checking carotid pulse If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.
