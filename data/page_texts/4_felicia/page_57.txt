5.1: Introduction
Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. A casualty can develop airway obstruction from either intrinsic or extrinsic (foreign body) causes.

Intrinsic Causes
- The tongue can fall backward into the pharynx and obstruct the airway in an unconscious casualty in the supine position.
- Blood from head and facial injuries can flow into the airway.
- Regurgitated stomach contents can enter the airway.

Extrinsic Causes 
Foreign bodies, e.g., food, dentures etc.

Contributing Factors
1. Large, poorly chewed pieces of meat/food.
2. Elevated blood alcohol levels.
3. Dentures.
4. Playing, crying, laughing, and talking with food in the mouth.

Precautions
1. Cut food (eg. fish balls, meat balls, fruit, etc) into small pieces. Chew slowly and thoroughly, especially when a child is eating or if the adult is wearing dentures.
2. Avoid excessive intake of alcohol.
3. Avoid laughing and talking when the mouth is full.
4. Discourage the child from running or playing while eating.
