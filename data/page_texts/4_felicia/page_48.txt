The correct placement of AED (Automated External Defibrillator) electrode pads for children: anterior-posterior and anterior-anterior.
In the anterior-posterior placement, one electrode pad is positioned on the center of the chest, just below the right collarbone, while the other pad is placed on the back, directly behind the front pad, between the shoulder blades.
In the anterior-anterior placement, one electrode pad is applied to the upper left side of the chest, below the collarbone, and the other pad is placed on the lower right side of the chest, below the nipple and above the abdomen.
