(C) Chest Compressions
- Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone).
  - Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.
  - Kneel by the side of the casualty.
  - Place the heel of the palm of the one hand on the lower half of the sternum (breastbone) and avoid the Xiphoid Process. The xiphoid process is a small bony structure located at the lower end of the sternum (breastbone).
  - Place the heel of the second hand on top of the first.
  - Interlace the fingers of both hands and lift the fingers off the chest wall.
  - Straighten both the elbows and lock them into position.
  - Position the shoulders directly over the casualty’s chest. Use the body weight to compress the casualty’s breastbone.
  - Depth of chest compression for children must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the child’s chest (about 4 to 5 cm).
  - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.
  - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each chest compression.
