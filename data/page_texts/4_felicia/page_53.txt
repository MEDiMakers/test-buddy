 Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). (See figure 4-6 and 4-7) Figure 4-6 – Start chest compressions Xiphoid Process Figure 4-7 – The Xiphoid Process o Ensure adequate exposure of the chest. o Kneel by the side of the casualty. o Place the heel of the palm of the one hand on the lower half of the sternum (breastbone) and avoid the Xiphoid Process. (See figure 4-7) o Place the heel of the second hand on top of the first. o Interlace the fingers of both hands and lift the fingers off the chest wall. (See figure 4-8) o Straighten both the elbows and lock them into position. o Position the shoulders directly over the casualty’s chest. Use the body weight to compress the casualty’s breastbone. Figure 4-8 – Interlace the fingers of both hands o Depth of chest compression for children must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the child’s chest (about 4 to 5 cm). o The compression rate is 100–120 per minute. o Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each chest compression.
