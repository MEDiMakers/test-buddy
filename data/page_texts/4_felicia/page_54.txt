Loud counting of chest compressions should be encouraged: 1&2&3&4&5&, 1&2&3&4&10&, 1&2&3&4&15, 1&2&3&4&20, 1&2&3&4&25(or say “two-five”), 1&2&3&4&30. After 30 chest compressions, open the airway and perform ventilations via BVM. (refer to the section on BVM in chapter 2) For community first responders (and health care providers without appropriate sized BVM available), if able, trained and willing: Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective. (see chapter 2) o Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth. o Provide 2 breaths by blowing steadily into the child’s mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise. o Release the nose after each breath. Do not interrupt chest compressions for more than 10 seconds to perform 2 breaths. Note:  If you are unable or unwilling to perform ventilations for any reasons, please perform continuous chest compressions at the rate of 100 – 120 per minute. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you may take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions). For trained healthcare providers Check for normal breathing and pulse after every 5 cycles of CPR 30:2. If normal breathing and pulse are absent or you are unsure, continue CPR 30:2.
