Use of AED in Children Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in children are usually from non-cardiac causes with majority of the casualties presenting with non-shockable cardiac rhythms (asystole or pulseless electrical activity). Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation. However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%.1 School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers. 2 1.

Recommendation for AED Use in Children The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) advocates early use of AEDs on children to analyse rhythms and provide defibrillation in cases of cardiac arrest with shockable rhythms. When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose
