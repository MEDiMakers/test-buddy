5.2: RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)
Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) can be either partial or complete. Coughing is the bodyâ€™s natural defence against airway obstruction.
A casualty with partial (mild) airway obstruction will cough to expel the foreign body. If the casualty is wheezing (breathing noisily with a wheezing sound) or coughing, this means that the airway is partially obstructed. Do not interfere. Allow the casualty to cough to expel the object himself/herself.
In complete airway obstruction, the casualty is unable to speak, breathe or cough and may become cyanotic (blue). The casualty will clutch the neck with thumb and fingers, the universal distress signal for choking that requires immediate action.

The universal sign of choking involves placing hands around the throat, indicating that the person is experiencing an airway obstruction and needs immediate help.
