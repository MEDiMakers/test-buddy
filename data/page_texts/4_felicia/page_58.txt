Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) can be either partial or complete. Coughing is the body’s natural defence against airway obstruction. Figure 5-1 – The universal sign of choking A casualty with partial (mild) airway obstruction will cough to expel the foreign body. If the casualty is wheezing (breathing noisily with a wheezing sound) or coughing, this means that the airway is partially obstructed. Do not interfere. Allow the casualty to cough to expel the object himself/herself. In complete airway obstruction, the casualty is unable to speak, breathe or cough and may become cyanotic (blue). The casualty will clutch the neck with thumb and fingers, the universal distress signal for choking (see figure 5-1) that requires immediate action (see figure 5-2).
