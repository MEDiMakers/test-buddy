Use of AED for Child/Infant If an AED with paediatric pads or mode is not available, an AED with adult pads may be used. In these cases, the risk/benefit ratio may be favourable, and the use of an AED (preferably with paediatric pads or mode) should be considered. For AEDs with paediatric pads or mode: o When the AED arrives, switch it on. o Switch to the paediatric electrode pads or mode. o Attach the electrode pads according to the illustrations on the placement of electrode pads (see figure 3-9). o Follow the AED’s instructions and continue chest compressions and ventilations until medical help arrives. For AEDs without paediatric pads or mode: o When the AED arrives, switch it on. o If only adult pads are available, ensure that the pads do not touch or overlap each other. Attach the defibrillation pads on front (right pad on central sternum) and back (left pad on the upper back between the shoulder blades) in an anterior-posterior electrode pads placement as shown (see figure 3-9). o Follow the AED’s instructions and continue chest compressions and ventilations until medical help arrives. Placement of Defibrillation Pads for Children/Infant 1. For AEDs recommending anterior-anterior electrode pads placement, ensure that the electrode pads are not touching or overlapping each other, and are at least 2cm apart (see figure 3-10).
