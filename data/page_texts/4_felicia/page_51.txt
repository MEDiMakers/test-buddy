 If the child is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call ‘995’ for SCDF EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). (see figure 4-2) If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for SCDF EMS and put on speaker phone mode. An SCDF emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone. (See figure 4-3) Figure 4-2 – Get help Figure 4-3 – Call 995 In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive casualty in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the casualty’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the casualty to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the casualty immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for SCDF EMS and get an AED. (A) Ask someone to get an AED Send someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The SCDF emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.
