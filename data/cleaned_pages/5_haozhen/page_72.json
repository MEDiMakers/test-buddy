        "Text": "6.1: INFANT CPR\nThis module addresses the care of infants with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.\nInfants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.\n(D) Check for Danger\nEnsure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.\n(R) Check for Responsiveness\n - The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’.\n - Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.\n - Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.\nFor CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back. ",
