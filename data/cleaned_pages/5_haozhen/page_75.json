        "Text": "(C) Chest Compressions\nSite of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest. Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions: Use your index finger to draw an imaginary line between the nipples to the centre of the sternum. Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next to your index finger on the center of the infant’s chest. Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest compressions using the pulp of the fingers. Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm). The compression rate is 100–120 per minute. Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression. ",
