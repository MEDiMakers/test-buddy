        "Text": "For Trained Healthcare Providers\nStep 5: Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation\nAttempt one ventilation via BVM (1st ventilation). If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations. Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective. (See chapter 2) Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth. Provide 1 breath by blowing steadily into the casualty’s mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise. Release the nose after each breath. If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR. If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation). Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR. ",
