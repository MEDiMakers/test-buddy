        "Text": "(B) Check for normal Breathing\nLook for the rise and fall of the chest. Do not take more than 10 seconds. It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping.\nFor trained healthcare providers only Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infantâ€™s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers. Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing. Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds. If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions. ",
