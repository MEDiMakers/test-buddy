        "Text": " Step 4: Open the airway\nPerform the Head-Tilt, Chin-lift manoeuvre to open the airway. While maintaining head tilt, open the mouth gently to check for visible foreign bodies. If no foreign body is seen, perform another 30 chest compressions. If a foreign body is seen, maintain the open airway with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre and insert the index finger of your other hand into the casualty’s mouth along the inside of the cheek. Use a hooking action to dislodge the foreign body and manoeuvre it out of the mouth. Take care not to force the foreign body deeper into the throat. This manoeuvre is known as the finger sweep. /nNote: Do not perform blind finger sweep. Blind finger sweep may push the object back or further into the airway. However, if there are no objects found in the mouth, repeat steps 3 and 4 until object has been removed. For lay rescuers – Once object has been removed, check for breathing. If breathing is absent, repeat steps 3 and 4 until breathing resumes or emergency help arrives. For trained healthcare providers – See step 5. ",
