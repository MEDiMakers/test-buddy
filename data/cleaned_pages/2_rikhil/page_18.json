{"page_18": {"Text": "When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body.\nUnless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning.\nFor example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death.\nCPR is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible.\nCPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions.\nWhen mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body.\nHowever, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation.\nChest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys.\nIf CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures.\nIn many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations.\nHands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.\nThis only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.\nThe next section takes you step-by-step through the procedures needed to perform CPR â€“ the basic skill needed to save lives in the event of cardiac arrest.\n", "Page": 18}}
