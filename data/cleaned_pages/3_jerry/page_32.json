        "Text": "At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. (See figure 3-1) However, not all cardiac arrests present as VF and may appear as other electrical rhythms (eg. asystole which is non-shockable). Figure 3-1 - Ventricular Fibrillation & Ventricular Tachycardia without pulse During VF, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for VF is a shock administered using an AED. This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating VF. If delayed or untreated, VF eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. (See figure 3-2) At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer CPR. In the past, only trained doctors, nurses and paramedics, could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of AEDs, which are able to analyse the casualtyâ€™s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates.
