        "Text": "The flowchart titled \"Algorithm for One-Rescuer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Use of Automated External Defibrillator (AED)\" provides a step-by-step guide for performing Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). Here is a detailed step-by-step flow of the chart:\n\n1. Check for Danger (D):\nEnsure the area is safe for both the rescuer and the casualty.\n\n2. Check Responsiveness (R):\nTry to get a response from the casualty.\n\n3. Shout for Help (S):\n(a) Shout \"Help!\"\n(b) Call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) and follow the dispatcherâ€™s instructions or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest).\n\n4. Get the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) (A):\nIf there is another person around, ask him/her to get the Automated External Defibrillator (AED).\nIf alone, do not leave the casualty.\n\n5. Check for Normal Breathing and Pulse (B):\nLook for the rise and fall of the chest (not more than 10 seconds).\nIf normal breathing (gasping is not normal breathing) is absent or unsure, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).\nHealthcare Provider only: Check for carotid pulse as well.\n\n6. Provide Continuous Chest Compressions (C):\nExpose the chest adequately.\nPerform chest compressions:\n    Lower half of sternum\n    Depth: 4-6 cm\n    Rate: 100-120 per minute\n    Allow complete chest recoil\nHealthcare Provider only: After 30 chest compressions\n    Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift\n    Provide 2 ventilations via Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM)\n    1 second per ventilation\n    Tidal Volume 400-600 milliliters or chest rises\n\n7. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Arrives:\n\nCheck for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Hazards:\n    Wet surfaces\n    Metallic surfaces\n    Flammable gases nearby\nContinue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)\nTurn on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED)\nEnsure the chest is bare and dry\nApply pads as printed on the Automated External Defibr\n",
