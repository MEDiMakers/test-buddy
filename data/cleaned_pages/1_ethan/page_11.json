        "Text": "circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible.\nAir contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about Â¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain. \nImmediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival.
