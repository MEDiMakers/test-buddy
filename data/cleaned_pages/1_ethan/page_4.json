        "Text": "Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality. \nA person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions. \nSurvival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuerâ€™s two hands. \n\n* White AE, Shaidah N, Asyikin N et al.
