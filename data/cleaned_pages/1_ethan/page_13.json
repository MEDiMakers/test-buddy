        "Text": "1.7: THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL\nThe essential steps for helping a cardiac arrest victim are illustrated in a system called the “Chain of Survival”. The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early CPR, Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.\n\nFirst Ring: Prevention \nPrevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles. \n\nSecond Ring: Early Activation and AED Access \nCall for ambulance (dial 995) and get an AED if visible and near-by. Follow the SCDF dispatcher’s instructions. \n\nThird Ring: Early CPR \nThe brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. CPR must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart. \n\nFourth Ring: Early Defibrillation \nAutomated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate. \n\nFifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance) \nQuick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival.
