        "Text": "On an ECG, normal heart rhythm, also known as the Normal Sinus Rhythm, appears as below:\n5 large squares = 1second\n1 small square = 0.04 s \n1 large square = 0.2 s\n1 QRS per second\nHeart rate = 60 per min\nCount the number of large intervals and divide into 300 squares between 2 RR\nThe human body has two lungs which absorb oxygen from the air that is breathed in. 21% of air consists of oxygen, of which 5% is extracted by the lungs. The extracted oxygen is passed to the blood within the capillaries of the lungs. The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart. \nExchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs \nThe remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life. ",
