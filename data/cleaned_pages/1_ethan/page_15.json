        "Text": "1.8: SCDF MYRESPONDER MOBILE APPLICATION\nIn Singapore, many of the emergency cases SCDF responds to could be quickly attended to by members of the public even before SCDF’s arrival. For example, more than 3000 people suffer from Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA), with a survival rate of just 5%, which could be improved by simple medical intervention within the first few critical minutes. At the same time, there are more than 1,000 minor fires (such as rubbish chute/bin fire) that could easily be extinguished using publicly-available means. (See figure 1-16) \n\nFigure 1-16 – Incidents that will trigger myResponder notifications\ndescription:\nCardiac Arrest\nAccept the myResponder alert and proceed to the specified location.\n- Use the app to locate nearby Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs).\n- Upon reaching the patient, perform CPR or apply an AED.\n- Hand over the case to the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) paramedics upon their arrival.\n\nMinor Fire\n- Accept the myResponder alert and go to the designated location.\n- Extinguish the fire using available resources such as extinguishers, buckets of water, domestic water taps, hoses, or drencher systems designed for rubbish chutes.\n- Provide the SCDF with up to three photos for scene assessment.\n\nMajor Incident\n- Accept the myResponder alert but do not approach closer to the specified location.\n- Provide SCDF with up to three photos and one video of the developing incident, if it is safe to do so.\n- Follow any instructions for evacuation immediately.\n\nThe myResponder mobile application is available on Apple and Android stores.
