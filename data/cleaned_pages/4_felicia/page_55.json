        "Text": "- If pulse is present and normal breathing is absent, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand.\n- Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse after 20 breaths.\n- If both the breathing and pulse are present, position the casualty in the supine position and continuously monitor the casualty until help arrives.\n\nIf there are 2 trained healthcare providers \n- The ratio of chest compressions to ventilations is 15:2.\n- Perform 10 cycles of 15 compressions and 2 ventilations within 2 minutes.\n\nContinue performing Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) until: \n- Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or\n- Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualtyâ€™s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or\n- Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.\n- Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.\n- Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse after at least five cycles of 30 compressions to two ventilations (done via a bag-valve mask). Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). ",
