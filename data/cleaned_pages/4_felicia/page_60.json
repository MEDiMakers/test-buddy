        "Text": "5.3: RELIEF OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)\nTechniques used to relieve Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) include the Heimlich Manoeuvre (abdominal thrusts) and chest thrusts for pregnant and obese casualties.\nThe Heimlich Manoeuvre, also known as the sub-diaphragmatic abdominal thrusts or abdominal thrusts is recommended for the relief of Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) in responsive adults (aged > 12 years) and children (aged 1 â€“ 12 years). The Heimlich Manoeuvre elevates the diaphragm and increase airway pressure, which forces air out from the lungs. This creates an artificial cough which can expel the foreign body from the airway.\nIn obese or pregnant casualties, chest thrusts should be used instead of abdominal thrusts.\n\nComplications from Heimlich Manoeuvre\nIf performed incorrectly, it may cause injuries to the internal organs resulting in rupture or laceration of abdominal or thoracic viscera.
