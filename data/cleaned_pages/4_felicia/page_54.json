(refer to the section on Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) in chapter 2) \nFor community first responders (and health care providers without appropriate sized Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) available), if able, trained and willing: \n- Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective. (see chapter 2)\n  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.\n  - Provide 2 breaths by blowing steadily into the child’s mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.\n  - Release the nose after each breath. \n- Do not interrupt chest compressions for more than 10 seconds to perform 2 breaths.\n\nNote: If you are unable or unwilling to perform ventilations for any reasons, please perform continuous chest compressions at the rate of 100 – 120 per minute. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you may take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions). \n\nFor trained healthcare providers \n- Check for normal breathing and pulse after every 5 cycles of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) 30:2. \n- If normal breathing and pulse are absent or you are unsure, continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) 30:2.
