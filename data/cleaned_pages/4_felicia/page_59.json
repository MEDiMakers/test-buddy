        "Text": "This is a flowchart titled \"Flowchart for conscious and unconscious foreign body airway obstruction.\" It guides the assessment and response to choking incidents.\nAssess severity\nThe first step is to assess the severity of the airway obstruction. Based on the assessment, the flowchart divides into two categories: Mild and Severe.\n\nMild\n- Partial Airway Obstruction (Able to produce sound, breathe or cough). \n- Do not interfere\n  - Allow the casualty to clear airway by coughing. Continue to check for deterioration (inability to produce sound, breathe or cough) or until obstruction is relieved. Consider calling 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) if repeated attempts by casualty are not successful *Avoid feeding the casualty water/food and do not shake the casualty in a attempt to dislodge the foreign body. \n  \nSevere \n- Complete Airway Obstruction (Unable to produce sound, breathe or cough). \n- Conscious \n  - Continuous abdominal thrusts or chest thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or casualty becomes unconscious. Chest thrusts for obese or pregnant casualty.\n- Unconscious \n  - Place casualty in a supine position on a flat and firm surface. Call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) and get an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) if visible and nearby. Start 30 chest compressions.
