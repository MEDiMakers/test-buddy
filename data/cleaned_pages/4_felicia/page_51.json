        "Text": "(S) Shout to get help \n- If the child is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call ‘995’ for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.\n- In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive casualty in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the casualty’s responsiveness and breathing. \n- If normal breathing is absent, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the casualty to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the casualty immediately to continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) and get an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). \n\n(A) Ask someone to get an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) \n- Send someone to get an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest Automated External Defibrillator (AED) and summon help from Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty. ",
