        "Text": "(C) Chest Compressions\n- Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone).\n  - Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.\n  - Kneel by the side of the casualty.\n  - Place the heel of the palm of the one hand on the lower half of the sternum (breastbone) and avoid the Xiphoid Process. The xiphoid process is a small bony structure located at the lower end of the sternum (breastbone).\n  - Place the heel of the second hand on top of the first.\n  - Interlace the fingers of both hands and lift the fingers off the chest wall.\n  - Straighten both the elbows and lock them into position.\n  - Position the shoulders directly over the casualty’s chest. Use the body weight to compress the casualty’s breastbone.\n  - Depth of chest compression for children must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the child’s chest (about 4 to 5 cm).\n  - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.\n  - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each chest compression.
