Safely position the unconscious casualty on a flat and firm surface.\n\n2. Shout for Help:\n   - Shout \"Help!\" and call 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), following the dispatcherâ€™s instructions.\n\n3. Perform 30 chest compressions.\n\n4. Check for Foreign Body (FB):\n   - If Foreign Body (FB) is seen:\n     - Open the mouth using Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift (HTCL) and check for a foreign body.\n     - Remove with a finger sweep.\n     - Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift (HTCL) and provide 1 ventilation.\n       - If chest rises:\n         - Check for normal breathing and pulse (not more than 10 seconds).\n           - If pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.\n           - If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within ten seconds, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).\n       - If chest does not rise:\n         - Re-attempt Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift (HTCL) and provide 1 ventilation again.\n           - If chest rises: Follow the same steps as above.\n           - If chest does not rise: Continue the cycle of chest compressions and rechecking for Foreign Body (FB).\n\n   - If no Foreign Body (FB) is seen:\n     - Check for normal breathing and pulse (not more than 10 seconds).\n       - If pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.\n       - If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within ten seconds, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).\n\nNote: \n   - HTCL stands for Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift.\n   \nThe flowchart guides healthcare providers through the process of relieving an airway obstruction in an unconscious infant, ensuring proper assessment and intervention at each step.",
