If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds. 2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you may take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions). ",
