If there is no BVM device available and the healthcare provider is unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, the healthcare provider should check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds. \n\nIf no BVM device is available and the healthcare provider is unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, the healthcare provider should perform continuous chest compressions. If the healthcare provider is a single rescuer and feeling tired, the healthcare provider may take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions)."
