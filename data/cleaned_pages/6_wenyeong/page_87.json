        "Text": "If foreign body is seen, maintain open airway with Chin-Lift and insert the little finger of your other hand into the infant’s mouth along the inside of the cheek. \n\nUse a hooking action to dislodge the foreign body and manoeuvre it out of the mouth. Take care not to force the foreign body deeper into the throat. This manoeuvre is known as the finger sweep.\n\nNote: \n Do not perform blind finger sweep. Blind finger sweep may push the object back or further into the airway. \n However, if there are no objects found in the mouth, repeat steps 3 and 4 until object has been removed. \n For lay rescuers – Once object has been removed, check for breathing. If breathing is absent, repeat steps 3 and 4 until breathing resumes or emergency help arrives. For trained healthcare providers – See step 5.\n\nFor Trained-Healthcare Provider \nStep 5: Bag-valve-mask (BVM) (Bag-Valve-Mask) ventilation \nAttempt one ventilation via BVM (Bag-Valve-Mask) (1st ventilation). \n\nIf BVM (Bag-Valve-Mask) is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-nose-and-mouth ventilations. \n\no Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective. (See Chapter 2)"
