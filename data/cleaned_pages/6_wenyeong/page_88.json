Figure 7-16 – Mouth-to-mouth-and-nose ventilation \n- If there is no resistance (chest rises), airway is clear. Proceed to check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). \n- If there is resistance (chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the infant’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. Re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation). \n- Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving. \n- Check for normal breathing and pulse. \n- If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). \n- If pulse is definitely present but the infant is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at 30 breaths per minute (one breath every 2 seconds) by giving one breath and count “2-a-thousand”. Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 30 breaths. Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse. \n- If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.\n",
