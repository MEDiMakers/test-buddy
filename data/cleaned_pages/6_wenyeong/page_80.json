        "Text": "Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing. In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts. Precautions Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between. Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant. Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time. Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating. 7.2: RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO) Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound). If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup. Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction. (See figure 7-1) ",
