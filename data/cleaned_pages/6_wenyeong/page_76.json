The mask should fit from the infant’s bridge of the nose to the chin.\n -Perform a gentle Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective. \n-Make a tight seal by placing your mouth over the infant’s nose and mouth.\n-Provide 2 breaths by blowing steadily into the infant’s nose and mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise. \n-Do not interrupt chest compressions for more than 10 seconds to perform 2 breaths. \nNote: -If you are unable or unwilling to perform ventilations for any reasons, please perform continuous chest compressions at the rate of 100 – 120 per minute. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you may take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions)."
