        "Text": "Loud counting of the compressions should be encouraged: 1&2&3&4&5&, 1&2&3&4&10&, 1&2&3&4&15, 1&2&3&4&20, 1&2&3&4&25 (or say “two-five”), 1&2&3&4&30. After 30 chest compressions, open the airway and perform ventilations via BVM (Bag-Valve-Mask). For community first responders (and health care providers without appropriate sized BVM (Bag-Valve-Mask) available), if able, trained and willing: \nIn healthcare settings, BVM (Bag-Valve-Mask) is used to deliver ventilations for the infant. The mask should fit from the infant’s bridge of the nose to the chin. Perform a gentle Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective. \nMake a tight seal by placing your mouth over the infant’s nose and mouth. Provide 2 breaths by blowing steadily into the infant’s nose and mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise. \nDo not interrupt chest compressions for more than 10 seconds to perform 2 breaths. \nNote:  If you are unable or unwilling to perform ventilations for any reasons, please perform continuous chest compressions at the rate of 100 – 120 per minute. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you may take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions)."
