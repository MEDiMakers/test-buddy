3.9: CHILD/INFANT DEFIBRILLATION
Use of Automated External Defibrillator (AED) in Children 
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in children are usually from non-cardiac causes with majority of the casualties presenting with non-shockable cardiac rhythms (asystole or pulseless electrical activity). 
Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation. 
However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%. School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.


Recommendation for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Use in Children 
The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) advocates early use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) on children to analyse rhythms and provide defibrillation in cases of cardiac arrest with shockable rhythms. When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose. If a paediatric dose-attenuating system is unavailable, then a standard Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be used.


Use of Automated External Defibrillator (AED) for Child/Infant 
(a) If an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with paediatric pads or mode is not available, an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with adult pads may be used. 
(b) In these cases, the risk/benefit ratio may be favourable, and the use of an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) (preferably with paediatric pads or mode) should be considered. 
(c) For Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) with paediatric pads or mode:
- When the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) arrives, switch it on.
- Switch to the paediatric electrode pads or mode.
- Attach the electrode pads according to the illustrations on the placement of electrode pads.
- Follow the Automated External Defibrillator's (AED's) instructions and continue chest compressions and ventilations until medical help arrives. 
(d) For Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) without paediatric pads or mode:
- When the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) arrives, switch it on.
- If only adult pads are available, ensure that the pads do not touch or overlap each other. Attach the defibrillation pads on front (right pad on central sternum) and back (left pad on the upper back between the shoulder blades) in an anterior-posterior electrode pads placement as shown.
- Follow the Automated External Defibrillator's (AED's) instructions and continue chest compressions and ventilations until medical help arrives.


Placement of Defibrillation Pads for Children/Infant
1. For Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) recommending anterior-anterior electrode pads placement, ensure that the electrode pads are not touching or overlapping each other, and are at least 2cm apart.


The correct placement of AED (Automated External Defibrillator) electrode pads for children: anterior-posterior and anterior-anterior.
In the anterior-posterior placement, one electrode pad is positioned on the center of the chest, just below the right collarbone, while the other pad is placed on the back, directly behind the front pad, between the shoulder blades.
In the anterior-anterior placement, one electrode pad is applied to the upper left side of the chest, below the collarbone, and the other pad is placed on the lower right side of the chest, below the nipple and above the abdomen.


4.1: CHILD CARDIO-PULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR)
This module addresses children from 1 to 12 years of age. 
Children in this age group rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest. 
Note:
- If a child is below 12 years old but of a larger size or a child that is above 12, perform chest compressions as in Adult Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). 


(D) Check for Danger 
Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the casualty is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the casualty should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible. 
(R) Check for Responsiveness 
- The rescuer should tap the child’s shoulders firmly and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’
- Avoid violent shaking of the child as this may result in injury.
- Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck. 
For Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) to be effective, the casualty must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the casualty is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the casualty over onto his/her back.


(S) Shout to get help 
- If the child is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call ‘995’ for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.
- In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive casualty in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the casualty’s responsiveness and breathing. 
- If normal breathing is absent, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the casualty to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the casualty immediately to continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) and get an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). 


(A) Ask someone to get an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) 
- Send someone to get an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest Automated External Defibrillator (AED) and summon help from Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty. 

(B) Check for normal Breathing
- Look for the rise and fall of the chest. 
- Do not take more than 10 seconds.
- It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you are unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping. (See https://youtu.be/T85vd3CBs04 for video of contrast between gasping and normal breathing) 

For trained healthcare providers:
- Checking of carotid pulse and breathing (not more than 10 seconds) should be done. 
- Check for carotid pulse when checking for normal breathing. Slide your fingers down to the groove at the side of the neck near you (this is the location of the carotid pulse).
- If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions. 

(C) Chest Compressions
- Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone).
  - Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.
  - Kneel by the side of the casualty.
  - Place the heel of the palm of the one hand on the lower half of the sternum (breastbone) and avoid the Xiphoid Process. The xiphoid process is a small bony structure located at the lower end of the sternum (breastbone).
  - Place the heel of the second hand on top of the first.
  - Interlace the fingers of both hands and lift the fingers off the chest wall.
  - Straighten both the elbows and lock them into position.
  - Position the shoulders directly over the casualty’s chest. Use the body weight to compress the casualty’s breastbone.
  - Depth of chest compression for children must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the child’s chest (about 4 to 5 cm).
  - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.
  - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each chest compression. 
  - Loud counting of chest compressions should be encouraged: 1&2&3&4&5&, 1&2&3&4&10&, 1&2&3&4&15, 1&2&3&4&20, 1&2&3&4&25(or say “two-five”), 1&2&3&4&30. 
  

After 30 chest compressions, open the airway and perform ventilations via Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM). (refer to the section on Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) in chapter 2) 
For community first responders (and health care providers without appropriate sized Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) available), if able, trained and willing: 
- Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective. (see chapter 2)
  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.
  - Provide 2 breaths by blowing steadily into the child’s mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.
  - Release the nose after each breath. 
- Do not interrupt chest compressions for more than 10 seconds to perform 2 breaths.
Note: If you are unable or unwilling to perform ventilations for any reasons, please perform continuous chest compressions at the rate of 100 – 120 per minute. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you may take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions). 


For trained healthcare providers 
- Check for normal breathing and pulse after every 5 cycles of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) 30:2. 
- If normal breathing and pulse are absent or you are unsure, continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) 30:2. 
- If pulse is present and normal breathing is absent, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand.
- Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse after 20 breaths.
- If both the breathing and pulse are present, position the casualty in the supine position and continuously monitor the casualty until help arrives.


If there are 2 trained healthcare providers:
- The ratio of chest compressions to ventilations is 15:2.
- Perform 10 cycles of 15 compressions and 2 ventilations within 2 minutes.


Continue performing Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) until: 
- Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or
- Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or
- Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.
- Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.
- Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse after at least five cycles of 30 compressions to two ventilations (done via a bag-valve mask). Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).


5.1: Introduction
Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. A casualty can develop airway obstruction from either intrinsic or extrinsic (foreign body) causes.


Intrinsic Causes
- The tongue can fall backward into the pharynx and obstruct the airway in an unconscious casualty in the supine position.
- Blood from head and facial injuries can flow into the airway.
- Regurgitated stomach contents can enter the airway.


Extrinsic Causes 
Foreign bodies, e.g., food, dentures etc.


Contributing Factors
1. Large, poorly chewed pieces of meat/food.
2. Elevated blood alcohol levels.
3. Dentures.
4. Playing, crying, laughing, and talking with food in the mouth.


Precautions
1. Cut food (eg. fish balls, meat balls, fruit, etc) into small pieces. Chew slowly and thoroughly, especially when a child is eating or if the adult is wearing dentures.
2. Avoid excessive intake of alcohol.
3. Avoid laughing and talking when the mouth is full.
4. Discourage the child from running or playing while eating. 


5.2: RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)
Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) can be either partial or complete. Coughing is the body’s natural defence against airway obstruction.
A casualty with partial (mild) airway obstruction will cough to expel the foreign body. If the casualty is wheezing (breathing noisily with a wheezing sound) or coughing, this means that the airway is partially obstructed. Do not interfere. Allow the casualty to cough to expel the object himself/herself.
In complete airway obstruction, the casualty is unable to speak, breathe or cough and may become cyanotic (blue). The casualty will clutch the neck with thumb and fingers, the universal distress signal for choking that requires immediate action.


The universal sign of choking involves placing hands around the throat, indicating that the person is experiencing an airway obstruction and needs immediate help.


This is a flowchart titled "Flowchart for conscious and unconscious foreign body airway obstruction." It guides the assessment and response to choking incidents.
Assess severity
The first step is to assess the severity of the airway obstruction. Based on the assessment, the flowchart divides into two categories: Mild and Severe.
Mild
- Partial Airway Obstruction (Able to produce sound, breathe or cough). 
- Do not interfere
  - Allow the casualty to clear airway by coughing. Continue to check for deterioration (inability to produce sound, breathe or cough) or until obstruction is relieved. Consider calling 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) if repeated attempts by casualty are not successful *Avoid feeding the casualty water/food and do not shake the casualty in a attempt to dislodge the foreign body. 
  
Severe 
- Complete Airway Obstruction (Unable to produce sound, breathe or cough). 
- Conscious 
  - Continuous abdominal thrusts or chest thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or casualty becomes unconscious. Chest thrusts for obese or pregnant casualty.
- Unconscious 
  - Place casualty in a supine position on a flat and firm surface. Call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) and get an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) if visible and nearby. Start 30 chest compressions. Figure 5-2 -Flowchart for conscious and unconscious foreign body airway obstruction 


5.3: RELIEF OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)
Techniques used to relieve Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) include the Heimlich Manoeuvre (abdominal thrusts) and chest thrusts for pregnant and obese casualties.
The Heimlich Manoeuvre, also known as the sub-diaphragmatic abdominal thrusts or abdominal thrusts is recommended for the relief of Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) in responsive adults (aged > 12 years) and children (aged 1 – 12 years). The Heimlich Manoeuvre elevates the diaphragm and increase airway pressure, which forces air out from the lungs. This creates an artificial cough which can expel the foreign body from the airway.
In obese or pregnant casualties, chest thrusts should be used instead of abdominal thrusts.


Complications from Heimlich Manoeuvre
If performed incorrectly, it may cause injuries to the internal organs resulting in rupture or laceration of abdominal or thoracic viscera.
