5.4: HEIMLICH MAN OEUVRE 
Step 1: Assessment  
- Ask: “Are you choking?” . If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.  
Note: 
- If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.  

Step 2: Position of rescuer  
- If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.  
- If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.   

Step 3: Locate the  landmark  
- Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.  
- Locate the navel.  
- Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process. 
- Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.  
- Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.
 
 
Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre  
- Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen. 
- Grasp your fist with your other hand.  
- Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.  
- Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.   
Note:  
- Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.  
 

The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre  
- To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.  
- If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.  
 

5.5: CHEST THRUSTS  
This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.  
Step 1: Assessment  
- Ask: “Are you choking?” If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.  

Step 2: Position of rescuer  
- If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty. 
- If the casualty is sitting, the rescuer kneels  and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.  

Step 3: Location of landmark  
- Place your arms under the casualty’s armpits encircling the chest. 
- Make a fist with one hand with the thumb in the palm.  
- Place thumb-side of fist on the middle of the casualty’s sternum (breastbone). 

Step 4: Chest thrusts  
- Grasp your fist with your other hand and bring yourself close to the casualty before giving quick backward thrusts . 
- Deliver each backward thrust firmly and distinctly. Perform  continuous backward chest thrusts with the intent of relieving the obstruction until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.  
 

5.6: RELIEF OF UNCONSCIOUS ADULT/CHILD  FBAO  
If the casualty becomes unconscious, proceed with the following steps. 
Step 1: Position the casualty  
- Support and position the casualty lying on his/her back on a firm flat surface . 

Step 2: Activate the Emergency Medical Service (EMS)  
- Rescuer shouts: “Help! Call ambulance 995  and get an AED !” However, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.  

Step 3: Start 30 chest compressions  
Locate the landmark and perform 30 chest compressions using the same location and techniques used for chest compressions in CPR. (Refer to Adult CPR, page 17 to 26; or Child CPR, page 48 to 53)  


Step 4: Open the airway 
- Perform the Head-Tilt, Chin-lift manoeuvre  to open the airway.  
- While maintaining head tilt, open the mouth gently to check for visible foreign  bodies.  
- If no foreign body is seen, perform another 30 chest compressions. 
- If a foreign body  is seen, maintain the open airway with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre and insert the index finger of your other hand into the casualty’s mouth along the inside of the cheek. 
- Use a hooking action to dislodge the foreign body and manoeuvre it out of the mouth. Take care not to force the foreign body deeper into the throat. This manoeuvre is known as the finger sweep . 
Note:  
- Do not perform blind finger sweep. Blind finger sweep may push the object back or further into the airway.  
- However, if there are no objects found in the mouth, repeat steps 3 and 4 until object has been removed.  
- For lay rescuers – Once object has been removed, check for breathing. If breathing is absent, repeat steps 3 and 4 until breathing resumes or emergency help arrives.  For trained healthcare providers – See step 5. 

For Trained Healthcare Providers:
 
Step 5: Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation  
- Attempt one v entilation via BVM (1st ventilation). If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.   
- Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective. 
- Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.  
- Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.   
- Release the nose after each breath.  
- If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.  
- If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).  
- Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.  
- Check for normal breathing and pulse.  
- If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR. 
- If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.  
- If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.  

Note:  
1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.  
2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you m ay take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions). (Refer to Adult CPR, page 17 to 26; or Child CPR, page 48 to 53 ) 


6.1: INFANT CPR  
 
This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.  
Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.  

(D) Check for Danger  
Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.  
 
(R) Check for Responsiveness  
- The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’.
- Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.   
- Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.  
 
For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.   

(S) Shout to get help  
If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.  
- In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED. 
 
(A) Ask someone to get an AED 
- Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty. 

(B) Check for normal Breathing  
- Look for the rise and fall of the chest 
- Do not take more than 10 seconds.  
- It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping. 
 
For trained healthcare providers only  
- Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.  
- Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing . 
- Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.  
- If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.  

 
(C) Chest Compressions  
- Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:  
    - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line 
    between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.  

    - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next 
    to your index finger on the center of 
    the infant’s chest.  
    
    - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and 
    ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest 
    compressions  using the pulp of the fingers. 
 
    - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm). 
    - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.  
    - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.
