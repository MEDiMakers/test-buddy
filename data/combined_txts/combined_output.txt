Based on national health statistics from the Ministry of Health in 2019, Singapore, ischemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to heart muscles) is the third most common cause of death, contributing to 18.8% of total mortality. 
A person with heart disease is prone to a heart attack, which could result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. According to a study conducted in Singapore*, the crude incidence rate of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in 2019 was 56.7 per 100,000 population in 2019 (3233 casualties), of which, 2239 cases (74%) of cardiac arrests occur in the home. Bystander CPR was performed on 1937 casualties (60%) and bystander defibrillation was performed on 340 (10.5%) of them. Out of 200 survivors (6.2%), 156 (4.8%) of them survived to be discharged with good-to-moderate neurological functions. 
Survival from sudden death can be maximized with the prompt application of basic life-saving skills of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). These can be performed by anyone, anywhere and anytime. All that is needed is the rescuer’s two hands. 


The heart is a muscular pump located in the center of the chest and slightly towards the left. 
The heart has two halves. The right side receives low oxygen blood from all parts of the body through veins and pumps it to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries to pick up oxygen.
The left side receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins and delivers it to all parts of the body, including the vital organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and brain.


The heart muscles receive oxygen rich blood via a set of coronary arteries. 
The pumping action of the heart is initiated by electrical signals from a pacemaker (sinoatrial or SA node), these signals travel to other parts of the heart in an orderly manner through a conductive network. The electrical signals from the heart can be picked up by an electrocardiogram (ECG).
The pumping action gives rise to an organized heart-beat at regular rate of 60-100 beats per minute in a normal person. 


On an electrocardiogram (ECG), normal heart rhythm, also known as the Normal Sinus Rhythm, appears as below:
5 large squares = 1second
1 small square = 0.04 s 
1 large square = 0.2 s
1 QRS per second
Heart rate = 60 per minute
Count the number of large intervals and divide into 300 squares between 2 RR
The human body has two lungs which absorb oxygen from the air that is breathed in. 21% of air consists of oxygen, of which 5% is extracted by the lungs. The extracted oxygen is passed to the blood within the capillaries of the lungs. The capillaries confluence into the pulmonary vein, which transports the oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart. 
Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the lungs 
The remaining 16% of unabsorbed oxygen is breathed out. This is extremely important in the context of mouth-to-mouth ventilation; the air that the rescuer ventilate into a cardiac arrest casualty can deliver sufficient oxygen to save and sustain life. 


1.3: RISK FACTORS FOR HEART ATTACK
Survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest is dismal even in the best cities. Prevention is of paramount importance to prevent heart attack from occurring. Several key risk factors contribute to the development of a heart attack. Human Beings can minimize the chance of getting a heart attack by controlling the risk factors. These are: 
Smoking – Smoking promotes the development of plaques within the coronary arteries and increases the risk of heart attack by two-fold. This habit should be avoided altogether.
Blood Pressure – If the blood pressure is high, there will be tremendous stress on the heart. Frequent blood pressure checks and reduction of salt in the diet is important. Those with high blood pressure should take their medicines and check their blood pressure regularly as instructed. 
Blood Sugars – Avoid a diet high in carbohydrates or refined sugars and control body weight through diet and exercise. If you have diabetes, take your medications regularly as instructed. 
Blood Lipids - Manage blood lipids (fats) by avoiding foods high in fats. Doing regular exercise could improve your blood lipid profile and take your medications regularly as instructed. 
Adopting healthy lifestyles by not smoking, eating foods in moderate amounts and regular exercise will decrease the risk of heart disease and other illnesses. 


1.4: WHAT HAPPENS IN A HEART ATTACK?
A heart attack occurs when cholesterol deposits and / or blood clots block one of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle. (See figure 1-10) The heart muscles beyond the blocked vessel dies due to lack of oxygenated blood. This is heart attack. 

Figure 1-10 Blocked coronary artery:
description:
This figure illustrates a blocked coronary artery, as seen in two sections labeled A and B.
Section A shows an overall view of the heart, highlighting the coronary arteries which supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. One of these arteries is indicated as being blocked.
Section B provides a detailed close-up view of the blocked area within the coronary artery. It shows:
Healthy heart muscle surrounding the artery. The blockage in the artery caused by a blood clot and plaque buildup, which impedes blood flow. A section of dead heart muscle affected by the reduced blood supply.

Symptoms of a Heart Attack 
A person who has a heart attack may experience any of these: 
Pain – described as tightness or discomfort either over the chest or upper part of the abdomen. This pain may also spread to the left shoulder, left arm, neck or lower jaw. Some may mistake this for indigestion or fatigue. 
Shortness of breath – A sudden difficulty in breathing may be a warning sign of a heart attack. 
Other Symptoms - Sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness 
If a heart attack is not treated promptly, deterioration of heart function will occur and the casualty may develop a sudden cardiac arrest. 
Learn to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. When someone experiences these, it is best to call for an ambulance (telephone: 995) and be taken to the nearest Emergency Department for immediate evaluation. 


1.5: WHAT HAPPENS IN A CARDIAC ARREST?
When a portion of the heart muscles dies, it affects the electrical impulses within the heart. The orderly flow of electrical signals within the heart is disrupted. This is a dangerous situation and an irregular, chaotic electrical rhythm called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) develops in many cases.
When VF occurs, the heart does not pump the blood to the rest of the body. This is a state of cardiac arrest and the casualty will be unconscious and stops breathing normally. 
Biological death and Clinical death 

Figure 1-13: Irreversible brain damage after 10 minutes 
description:
0 minutes: Breathing stops. Heart will soon stop beating.
4-6 minutes: Brain damage possible.
6-10 minutes: Brain damage likely.
Over 10 minutes: Irreversible brain damage certain.


When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart stops pumping and circulation stops. The oxygen level in the blood decreases, causing brain damage. If this situation is reversed immediately, survival chance could be as high as 90%. With a 6 minutes delay, this drops to 40–50% and at 9 minutes, it is a dismal 10%. (See figure 1-13) This is known as clinical death. Unless the circulation is restarted quickly, organ death will start to occur. The most sensitive organ is the brain and if the 
circulation to the brain is not started within about 4 minutes, permanent and irreversible brain damage will start to occur. This is known as biological death. It is therefore important to start CPR as quickly as possible.
Air contains approximately 21% oxygen at sea level. During its passage through the body, only about ¼ of oxygen is utilised and hence exhaled air contains approximately 16% oxygen. When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, there is sufficient oxygen in the exhaled air to keep the casualty alive. Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine, thereby helping to circulate the blood and deliver oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain. 
Immediate CPR and defibrillation are key components for increased chances of survival. 


1.6:  OTHER  COMMON  CAUSES  OF  CARDIAC ARREST
A heart attack is the most common cause of cardiac arrest. There are other causes, which include: 
Drug overdose, Choking, Smoke inhalation, Severe Trauma, Drowning, Electrocution, Severe allergy, Stroke
Death in these situations can be prevented if someone trained in CPR and first-aid skills provides prompt help. 


1.7: THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL
The essential steps for helping a cardiac arrest victim are illustrated in a system called the “Chain of Survival”. The seven rings in this chain are: Prevention, Early Recognition and Access, Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Early Defibrillation, Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance), Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Recovery.

First Ring: Prevention 
Prevention is better than intervention. A healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce the risk of heart diseases. Going for regular medical check-ups can help detect problems early and prompt the individuals to seek treatment early and adjust their diet and lifestyles. 
Second Ring: Early Activation and Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) Access 
Call for ambulance (dial 995) and get an Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) if visible and near-by. Follow the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) dispatcher’s instructions. 
Third Ring: Early cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 
The brain cells start dying within 4-6 minutes of cardiac arrest. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be initiated as soon as possible to provide blood and oxygen flow to the brain and heart. 
Fourth Ring: Early Defibrillation 
Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are increasingly available in the community, at lift lobbies, void decks, gymnasium, shopping malls, hotels, airports and schools etc. Apply onto the casualty and be ready to defibrillate. 
Fifth Ring: Emergency Medical Services (Ambulance) 
Quick access to the scene and transport to the hospital makes a difference to the casualty’s chances of survival. 
Sixth Ring: Advanced Cardiac Life Support
Medical teams will provide advanced cardiac life support at the hospital with the use of Intravenous/Intraosseous (IV/IO) medication and delivery of oxygen via mechanical systems (ie. Bag-Valve Masks and ventilators). 
Seventh Ring: Recovery 
To ensure a good survival outcome after OHCA requires continued community and medical support (ie. social services, physio/occupational therapy, nutritional guidance, etc) and therapy to re-habilitate the individual back to normalcy. 


1.8: SCDF MYRESPONDER MOBILE APPLICATION
In Singapore, many of the emergency cases SCDF responds to could be quickly attended to by members of the public even before SCDF’s arrival. For example, more than 3000 people suffer from Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA), with a survival rate of just 5%, which could be improved by simple medical intervention within the first few critical minutes. At the same time, there are more than 1,000 minor fires (such as rubbish chute/bin fire) that could easily be extinguished using publicly-available means. (See figure 1-16) 

Figure 1-16 – Incidents that will trigger myResponder notifications
description:
Cardiac Arrest
Accept the myResponder alert and proceed to the specified location.
- Use the app to locate nearby Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs).
- Upon reaching the patient, perform CPR or apply an AED.
- Hand over the case to the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) paramedics upon their arrival.


Minor Fire
- Accept the myResponder alert and go to the designated location.
- Extinguish the fire using available resources such as extinguishers, buckets of water, domestic water taps, hoses, or drencher systems designed for rubbish chutes.
- Provide the SCDF with up to three photos for scene assessment.

Major Incident
- Accept the myResponder alert but do not approach closer to the specified location.
- Provide SCDF with up to three photos and one video of the developing incident, if it is safe to do so.
- Follow any instructions for evacuation immediately.


3.9: CHILD/INFANT DEFIBRILLATION
Use of Automated External Defibrillator (AED) in Children 
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in children are usually from non-cardiac causes with majority of the casualties presenting with non-shockable cardiac rhythms (asystole or pulseless electrical activity). 
Thus, proper ventilation and oxygenation are critical in paediatric resuscitation. 
However, ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital paediatric arrest also occurs. Reviews of out-of-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest have reported incidence of shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) as the initial cardiac rhythm to be from 5-19%. School-going children and adolescents were reported to have higher incidence of shockable rhythms compared to infants, toddlers and preschoolers.


Recommendation for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Use in Children 
The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) advocates early use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) on children to analyse rhythms and provide defibrillation in cases of cardiac arrest with shockable rhythms. When recognised early and rapidly treated, paediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia have a higher survival rate than those with other rhythms. It is recommended that a paediatric dose-attenuating system be used in children aged 1-12 years to reduce the energy dose delivered by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This may be done either via a paediatric- specific pad-cable system or an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with a key or switch to select a smaller dose. If a paediatric dose-attenuating system is unavailable, then a standard Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be used.


Use of Automated External Defibrillator (AED) for Child/Infant 
(a) If an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with paediatric pads or mode is not available, an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with adult pads may be used. 
(b) In these cases, the risk/benefit ratio may be favourable, and the use of an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) (preferably with paediatric pads or mode) should be considered. 
(c) For Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) with paediatric pads or mode:
- When the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) arrives, switch it on.
- Switch to the paediatric electrode pads or mode.
- Attach the electrode pads according to the illustrations on the placement of electrode pads.
- Follow the Automated External Defibrillator's (AED's) instructions and continue chest compressions and ventilations until medical help arrives. 
(d) For Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) without paediatric pads or mode:
- When the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) arrives, switch it on.
- If only adult pads are available, ensure that the pads do not touch or overlap each other. Attach the defibrillation pads on front (right pad on central sternum) and back (left pad on the upper back between the shoulder blades) in an anterior-posterior electrode pads placement as shown.
- Follow the Automated External Defibrillator's (AED's) instructions and continue chest compressions and ventilations until medical help arrives.


Placement of Defibrillation Pads for Children/Infant
1. For Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) recommending anterior-anterior electrode pads placement, ensure that the electrode pads are not touching or overlapping each other, and are at least 2cm apart.


The correct placement of AED (Automated External Defibrillator) electrode pads for children: anterior-posterior and anterior-anterior.
In the anterior-posterior placement, one electrode pad is positioned on the center of the chest, just below the right collarbone, while the other pad is placed on the back, directly behind the front pad, between the shoulder blades.
In the anterior-anterior placement, one electrode pad is applied to the upper left side of the chest, below the collarbone, and the other pad is placed on the lower right side of the chest, below the nipple and above the abdomen.


4.1: CHILD CARDIO-PULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR)
This module addresses children from 1 to 12 years of age. 
Children in this age group rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest. 
Note:
- If a child is below 12 years old but of a larger size or a child that is above 12, perform chest compressions as in Adult Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). 


(D) Check for Danger 
Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the casualty is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the casualty should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible. 
(R) Check for Responsiveness 
- The rescuer should tap the child’s shoulders firmly and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’
- Avoid violent shaking of the child as this may result in injury.
- Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck. 
For Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) to be effective, the casualty must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the casualty is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the casualty over onto his/her back.


(S) Shout to get help 
- If the child is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call ‘995’ for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.
- In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive casualty in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the casualty’s responsiveness and breathing. 
- If normal breathing is absent, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the casualty to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the casualty immediately to continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) and get an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). 


(A) Ask someone to get an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) 
- Send someone to get an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest Automated External Defibrillator (AED) and summon help from Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty. 


(B) Check for normal Breathing
- Look for the rise and fall of the chest. 
- Do not take more than 10 seconds.
- It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you are unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping. (See https://youtu.be/T85vd3CBs04 for video of contrast between gasping and normal breathing) 


For trained healthcare providers:
- Checking of carotid pulse and breathing (not more than 10 seconds) should be done. 
- Check for carotid pulse when checking for normal breathing. Slide your fingers down to the groove at the side of the neck near you (this is the location of the carotid pulse).
- If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions. 


(C) Chest Compressions
- Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone).
  - Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.
  - Kneel by the side of the casualty.
  - Place the heel of the palm of the one hand on the lower half of the sternum (breastbone) and avoid the Xiphoid Process. The xiphoid process is a small bony structure located at the lower end of the sternum (breastbone).
  - Place the heel of the second hand on top of the first.
  - Interlace the fingers of both hands and lift the fingers off the chest wall.
  - Straighten both the elbows and lock them into position.
  - Position the shoulders directly over the casualty’s chest. Use the body weight to compress the casualty’s breastbone.
  - Depth of chest compression for children must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the child’s chest (about 4 to 5 cm).
  - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.
  - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each chest compression. 
  - Loud counting of chest compressions should be encouraged: 1&2&3&4&5&, 1&2&3&4&10&, 1&2&3&4&15, 1&2&3&4&20, 1&2&3&4&25(or say “two-five”), 1&2&3&4&30. 
  

After 30 chest compressions, open the airway and perform ventilations via Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM). (refer to the section on Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) in chapter 2) 
For community first responders (and health care providers without appropriate sized Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) available), if able, trained and willing: 
- Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective. (see chapter 2)
  - Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.
  - Provide 2 breaths by blowing steadily into the child’s mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.
  - Release the nose after each breath. 
- Do not interrupt chest compressions for more than 10 seconds to perform 2 breaths.
Note: If you are unable or unwilling to perform ventilations for any reasons, please perform continuous chest compressions at the rate of 100 – 120 per minute. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you may take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions). 


For trained healthcare providers 
- Check for normal breathing and pulse after every 5 cycles of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) 30:2. 
- If normal breathing and pulse are absent or you are unsure, continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) 30:2. 
- If pulse is present and normal breathing is absent, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand.
- Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse after 20 breaths.
- If both the breathing and pulse are present, position the casualty in the supine position and continuously monitor the casualty until help arrives.


If there are 2 trained healthcare providers:
- The ratio of chest compressions to ventilations is 15:2.
- Perform 10 cycles of 15 compressions and 2 ventilations within 2 minutes.


Continue performing Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) until: 
- Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or
- Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or
- Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.
- Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives.
- Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse after at least five cycles of 30 compressions to two ventilations (done via a bag-valve mask). Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).


5.1: Introduction
Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. A casualty can develop airway obstruction from either intrinsic or extrinsic (foreign body) causes.


Intrinsic Causes
- The tongue can fall backward into the pharynx and obstruct the airway in an unconscious casualty in the supine position.
- Blood from head and facial injuries can flow into the airway.
- Regurgitated stomach contents can enter the airway.


Extrinsic Causes 
Foreign bodies, e.g., food, dentures etc.


Contributing Factors
1. Large, poorly chewed pieces of meat/food.
2. Elevated blood alcohol levels.
3. Dentures.
4. Playing, crying, laughing, and talking with food in the mouth.


Precautions
1. Cut food (eg. fish balls, meat balls, fruit, etc) into small pieces. Chew slowly and thoroughly, especially when a child is eating or if the adult is wearing dentures.
2. Avoid excessive intake of alcohol.
3. Avoid laughing and talking when the mouth is full.
4. Discourage the child from running or playing while eating. 


5.2: RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)
Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) can be either partial or complete. Coughing is the body’s natural defence against airway obstruction.
A casualty with partial (mild) airway obstruction will cough to expel the foreign body. If the casualty is wheezing (breathing noisily with a wheezing sound) or coughing, this means that the airway is partially obstructed. Do not interfere. Allow the casualty to cough to expel the object himself/herself.
In complete airway obstruction, the casualty is unable to speak, breathe or cough and may become cyanotic (blue). The casualty will clutch the neck with thumb and fingers, the universal distress signal for choking that requires immediate action.


The universal sign of choking involves placing hands around the throat, indicating that the person is experiencing an airway obstruction and needs immediate help.


This is a flowchart titled "Flowchart for conscious and unconscious foreign body airway obstruction." It guides the assessment and response to choking incidents.
Assess severity
The first step is to assess the severity of the airway obstruction. Based on the assessment, the flowchart divides into two categories: Mild and Severe.
Mild
- Partial Airway Obstruction (Able to produce sound, breathe or cough). 
- Do not interfere
  - Allow the casualty to clear airway by coughing. Continue to check for deterioration (inability to produce sound, breathe or cough) or until obstruction is relieved. Consider calling 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) if repeated attempts by casualty are not successful *Avoid feeding the casualty water/food and do not shake the casualty in a attempt to dislodge the foreign body. 
Severe 
- Complete Airway Obstruction (Unable to produce sound, breathe or cough). 
- Conscious 
  - Continuous abdominal thrusts or chest thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or casualty becomes unconscious. Chest thrusts for obese or pregnant casualty.
- Unconscious 
  - Place casualty in a supine position on a flat and firm surface. Call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) and get an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) if visible and nearby. Start 30 chest compressions. Figure 5-2 -Flowchart for conscious and unconscious foreign body airway obstruction 


5.3: RELIEF OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO)
Techniques used to relieve Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) include the Heimlich Manoeuvre (abdominal thrusts) and chest thrusts for pregnant and obese casualties.
The Heimlich Manoeuvre, also known as the sub-diaphragmatic abdominal thrusts or abdominal thrusts is recommended for the relief of Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) in responsive adults (aged > 12 years) and children (aged 1 – 12 years). The Heimlich Manoeuvre elevates the diaphragm and increase airway pressure, which forces air out from the lungs. This creates an artificial cough which can expel the foreign body from the airway.
In obese or pregnant casualties, chest thrusts should be used instead of abdominal thrusts.


Complications from Heimlich Manoeuvre
If performed incorrectly, it may cause injuries to the internal organs resulting in rupture or laceration of abdominal or thoracic viscera. 


INTRODUCTION: 
Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing. 
In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts. 
Precautions:
 -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between. 
-Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant. 
 -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.
 -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating. 
 RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO) 
Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound). 
If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup. 
Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.


Assessing severity:
1. Mild: Partial Airway Obstruction
(Able to produce sound, breathe, or cough)
Do not interfere:
Allow the casualty to clear the airway by coughing.
Continue to check for deterioration (inability to produce sound, breathe, or cough) or until obstruction is relieved.
Consider calling 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS if repeated attempts by the casualty are not successful.
Note: Avoid feeding the casualty water/food and do not shake the casualty in an attempt to dislodge the foreign body.


2. Severe: Complete Airway Obstruction
(Unable to produce sound, breathe, or cough)
If Conscious:
Perform 5 back blows and 5 chest thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.


If Unconscious:
Place the casualty in a supine position on a flat and firm surface.
Call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED if visible and nearby.
Start 30 chest compressions.


Step 1: Assessment 
Infant is conscious and has stridor.
If the obstruction is getting worse (complete airway obstruction), you will notice at least one of the following: 
-Loss of voice. 
-Increased breathing difficulty. 
-The infant’s face may turn blue. 
Immediately attempt to relieve the airway obstruction. 
Step 2: Back blows and chest thrusts technique 
Slide your arm under the infant to support the head with your palm and the back with your forearm. 
Support the head and back of the infant’s body 
“Sandwich” the infant: 
- With your other hand, support infant’s jaw with your thumb on one side and the rest of your fingers on the other side. 
Place your forearm on the infant’s chest.


Support the infant’s head and body as a unit. 
- Stride one leg forward (same side as the forearm supporting the infant) by bending the knee. Ensure that the foot is flat on the floor. Do not tip-toe. 
 -Straddle the infant facing downwards with the head lower than the body. 
 -Rest the forearm that is supporting infant’s chest onto the thigh (same side as the hand, making sure that the infant’s head is lower than the body.) 
Deliver 5 back blows forcefully between the shoulder blades with the heel of your other hand. 
“Sandwich” the infant and turn the infant over with head lower than the body. 
Rest the forearm that is supporting the infant’s back onto the thigh (same side as the hand) to support the infant. 
- Draw an imaginary line between infant’s nipples with the ring (fourth) finger to the centre of the chest. 
Place your middle and index fingers (third and second) next to your ring (fourth) finger.'
- Lift up your ring (fourth) finger and deliver 5 chest thrusts over the lower half of the sternum (breastbone).
- If a foreign body is seen, place the infant on a firm flat surface and remove the foreign body with your little finger.
- Repeat back blows and chest thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the infant becomes unconscious. Figure 7-7 – Deliver 5 chest thrusts. Note: 


Note:  
- Do not tip-toe when performing back blows and chest thrusts as the rescuer may lose balance and fall.
- Each back blow and chest thrust should be delivered with sufficient force and with the intention of expelling the foreign body.
- If foreign body is seen, maintain open airway with Chin-Lift and insert the little finger of your other hand into the infant’s mouth along the inside of the cheek.
- Use a hooking action to dislodge the foreign body and manoeuvre it out of the mouth. Take care not to force the foreign body deeper into the throat. This manoeuvre is known as the finger sweep.


Note:
- Do not perform blind finger sweep. Blind finger sweep may push the object back or further into the airway.
- However, if there are no objects found in the mouth, repeat steps 3 and 4 until object has been removed.
- For lay rescuers – Once object has been removed, check for breathing. If breathing is absent, repeat steps 3 and 4 until breathing resumes or emergency help arrives. For trained healthcare providers – See step 5.


For Trained Healthcare Provider:
Step 5: Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) ventilation
- Attempt one ventilation via Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) (1st ventilation). If Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-nose-and-mouth ventilations.
    - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.
    - Seal your lips around the casualty’s nose and mouth. 
    - Provide 1 breath by blowing steadily into the infant’s mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise. Figure 7-16 – Mouth-to-mouth-and-nose ventilation 
- If there is no resistance (chest rises), airway is clear. Proceed to check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). 
- If there is resistance (chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the infant’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. Re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation). 
- Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving. 
- Check for normal breathing and pulse. 
- If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). 
- If pulse is definitely present but the infant is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at 30 breaths per minute (one breath every 2 seconds) by giving one breath and count “2-a-thousand”. Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 30 breaths. Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse. 
- If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.

The myResponder mobile application is available on Apple and Android stores. 
myResponder works by notifying members of the public – also known as Community First Responders (CFRs) – of cardiac arrest and fire cases within 400m of their location.
myResponder will also highlight nearby AEDs that may be available to responders, and provide guided advisories in the mitigation of minor fires.
CFRs can then proceed to the stated location and assist by performing Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or applying an Automated external defibrillator (AED) to revive the patient, mitigating minor fires using available extinguishing means, or providing further information to SCDF’s 995 Operations Centre.
Response is entirely voluntary, however, volunteers are encouraged to respond, when they are available and within safe and reasonable means.
1.18 – The above QR code works for both Apple iOS and Google Android OS and will direct to the App Store or Google Play respectively.
The myResponder function is also available within the SGSecure application


When the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing through the body.
Unless the flow is restarted quickly, other organs in the body will stop functioning.
For example, if the blood does not flow to the brain for 4 to 6 minutes, it could result in brain death.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a series of actions required to restart the heart and get the blood flowing once again as soon as possible.
CPR includes mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compressions.
When mouth-to-mouth ventilation is done during CPR, oxygen is introduced into the body.
However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were taught on the use of bag-valve-mask (BVM) instead of mouth-to-mouth (MTM) ventilation.
Chest compression squeezes the heart between the breastbone and the spine and thereby helps to circulate the blood and deliver the oxygen to the vital organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys.
If CPR is performed promptly and correctly: Heart function may be restored, and Circulation may be maintained until institution of other life support measures.
In many cases, rescuers in the community are unwilling and/or unable to provide ventilations.
Hands only (chest compressions only) CPR can be initiated.
This only requires continuous chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth ventilation, is easier to learn and is as effective as standard CPR.


The next section takes you step-by-step through the procedures needed to perform CPR – the basic skill needed to save lives in the event of cardiac arrest
MNEMONIC: DRSABC 
D Check for Danger 
R Check Responsiveness 
S Shout to get help and call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) Emergency Medical Services (EMS) 
A Ask someone to get an AED 
B Check for Normal Breathing and Pulse (for trained Healthcare Providers) Provide continuous Chest Compressions 
Notes: If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you may take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 continuous chest compressions).
For Healthcare Provider only: If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions. 2.1 – One rescuer CPR steps *BVM: Bag Valve Mask 


Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment.
Resuscitation should start where the casualty is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the casualty should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.
(R) Check for Responsiveness The rescuer should tap the casualty’s shoulders firmly and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you okay?’. Avoid violent shaking of the casualty as this may result in injury.
Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck in the event of injuries to the head and neck. 2.2 – Tap shoulder for response 


For Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to be effective, the casualty must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface.
If the casualty is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the casualty over onto his/her back.
(S) Shout to get help If the adult is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call ‘995’ for SCDF EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest).
If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) Emergency Medical Service (EMS) and put on speaker phone mode.
An SCDF emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions 2.3 – Call 995 for an ambulance 


In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive casualty in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the casualty’s responsiveness and breathing.
If normal breathing is absent, chest compressions should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the casualty to seek help.
Note: - However, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for SCDF EMS and get an AED.
(A) Ask someone to get an AED Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance.
The SCDF emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity.
However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty.
(B) Check for normal Breathing Look for the rise and fall of the chest.
Checking for normal breathing should not take more than ten seconds.
It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest (gasping can also happen 2.4 – Ask someone to get an AED 2.5 - Look for normal breathing in severe asthmatic 


For trained healthcare providers, Checking of carotid pulse and breathing should not take more than 10 seconds.
Check for carotid pulse when checking for normal breathing.
Slide your fingers down to the groove at the side of the neck near you (this is the location of the carotid pulse).
If unsure about the presence of carotid pulse and no normal breathing, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.


(C) Chest Compressions Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone).
- Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.
- Kneel by the side of the casualty.
- Place the heel of one hand on the lower half of the sternum (breastbone) and avoid the Xiphoid Process.
- Place the heel of the second hand on top of the first.
- Interlace the fingers of both hands and lift the fingers off the chest wall.
- Straighten both the elbows and lock them into position.
- Position the shoulders directly over the casualty’s chest.
Use the body weight to compress the casualty’s sternum (breastbone).
- Depth of chest compression for adults must be at least 4 cm but not more than 6 cm.
- The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.
- Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.
- Loud counting of the chest compressions should be encouraged: 1and2and3and4and5, 1and2and3and4and10,


If tired after 100 compressions, rescuer can take up to 10 seconds of rest and then resume chest compressions.
2.6 - Xiphoid Process (Female casualty) – to be avoided 
2.7 - Xiphoid Process (Male casualty) – to be avoided 
2.8 – Lift fingers off the chest wall and interlock hands 
2.9 - Compression and release during CPR 


Perform 30 chest compressions and provide 2 ventilations via a Bag Valve Mask (BVM).
Complete 5 cycles of 30 compressions and 2 ventilations before re-assessing breathing and circulation.
Perform BVM ventilations: Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre.
An open airway will ensure BVM ventilations are effective.
In the unresponsive casualty, muscle tone is impaired resulting in the tongue falling backward and obstructing the airway.
As the tongue is attached to the lower jaw, moving the lower jaw forward will lift the tongue away from the back of the throat and open the airway.
Head-tilt-Place your palm on the forehead and push it backwards.
Chin-lift – Use the index and middle fingers of your other hand to lift the bony part of the chin upwards.
2.10-The airway blocked by the tongue 
2.11-The Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift Manoeuvre When using a Bag Valve Mask (BVM), select a mask that fits over the mouth and nose of the casualty – The nasal portion of the mask over casualty’s nose high enough to cover the bridge without air leaks 
2.12-appropriate mask 


E – C hand placement – ‘E’: Using one hand, hold the mask with your middle and index finger wrapped around the connector stem of the mask.
‘C’: Extend your thumb underneath the casualty’s jaw, and pull it upward into the mask.
2.13 – ‘E-C’ hand placement While maintaining the upward traction on casualty’s jaw, press the mask downward onto the face to attain a tight mask seal.
2.14 – Maintaining the upward traction of the jaw and downward traction of the mask Perform ventilation by squeezing the bag steadily and smoothly using your other hand over 1 second.
Then, release the bag to allow it to reinflate fully before providing second ventilation.
Each ventilation should be enough to make the chest rise.
This is approximately 400 – 600 ml of air.
Do not interrupt chest compressions for more than 10 seconds to perform 2 ventilations
- Do not press deeply into the soft tissues under the chin.
- Do not place your hands or the mask on the casualty’s eyes as doing so may damage the eyes or cause a vagal reaction.
- Excessive force and rapid insufflation increase gastric distension.
- If BVM is not available, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations if you are trained and willing to perform.
- If you are unable or unwilling to perform ventilations for any reasons, please perform continuous chest compressions at the rate of 100 – 120 per minute.


If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you may take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions).
The cycles of 30 chest compressions to 2 ventilations  should be continued until one of the following occurs: 2.15 – 30 chest compressions followed by 2 ventilations via bag-valve-mask (BVM) An AED is connected to the casualty and prompts you to stop CPR.
The ambulance crew arrives and takes over further care of the casualty.
The casualty regains normal breathing or consciousness.
Continue to perform Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until: Paramedic takes over from the rescuer; or Automated external defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing.
Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse after at least five cycles 


Summary on selection of appropriate mask and ventilation bag size for bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation Adult (>12 yrs old) Child (1–12 yrs old) Infant (<1 yr old) Mask size Face mask should extend from the bridge of the nose to the cleft of the chin, covering the nose and the mouth but avoiding compression of the eyes. Ventilation bag size 1500-2000 mls 500-1500 mls 500 mls Note: - The tidal volume delivered should be sufficient to produce a normal chest rise.
For Trained-Healthcare Providers Check for normal breathing and pulse after every 5 cycles of CPR 30:2.


If normal breathing and pulse are absent or you are unsure, continue CPR 30:2
If pulse is present and normal breathing is absent, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand.
Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths.
Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.
If both the breathing and pulse are present, maintain the casualty in a supine position and continuously monitor the casualty until help arrives


Resuscitation training should simulate the environment that rescuers may find themselves in.
For example, healthcare providers should practice resuscitation skills on manikins on a trolley bed  or stand on a step stool at the side of the trolley bed.
This is to ensure the elbows can be straightened to facilitate chest compressions.
2.16 –Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on a trolley bed For resuscitation involving two or more rescuers, one rescuer can focus on chest compressions with the other handling the ventilations.
Additional rescuers can be delegated with other tasks such as calling 995 for SCDF or retrieving and using the Automated external defibrillator (AED).
Although chest compressions are commonly performed by kneeling at the side of the casualty, there may be specific circumstances involving narrow alleys, walkways or corridors where the rescuer may have to perform chest compressions by positioning over the head instead of the usual lateral side.

2.17 – Overhead CPR In the case of a passenger aircraft, a rescuer should kneel in the leg-space in front of the aisle seats to perform chest compressions if the casualty cannot be transferred within a few seconds to an area with adequate floor space such as the galley


3.1: The Importance of Early Defibrillation:
At the time of a sudden cardiac arrest, the most common underlying cardiac rhythm is an irregular and chaotic electrical rhythm (shockable rhythms) called Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) without pulse. However, not all cardiac arrests present as Ventricular Fibrillation and may appear as other electrical rhythms (for example, asystole which is non-shockable). 
During Ventricular Fibrillation, the heart muscles do not contract effectively and delivery of blood to the rest of the body ceases. The treatment for Ventricular Fibrillation is a shock administered using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This shock, together with chest compressions, will reinstate normal heart rhythm and contractility if administered as soon as possible (within 4 minutes). The survival rate decreases by 7-10% for every minute of delay in treating Ventricular Fibrillation. If delayed or untreated, Ventricular Fibrillation eventually degenerates into a fatal rhythm known as asystole where the heart has no electrical activity as reflected by a flat line tracing. At this juncture, the only treatment possible is to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). 
In the past, only trained doctors, nurses, and paramedics could perform manual defibrillation as it requires the operator to recognize the cardiac rhythm of the casualty, whether it is shockable or non-shockable. Since the invention of Automated External Defibrillators, which are able to analyze the casualty’s cardiac rhythm through the electrode pads and advise if a shock is needed, a lay rescuer can now perform the defibrillation, thus improving survival rates.
The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be brought to every person in cardiac arrest. Therefore, when calling 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance, also call for an Automated External Defibrillator by instructing others nearby “Get an Automated External Defibrillator”. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty. 
Research has shown that cardiac arrest casualties with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) who are treated promptly have the best chances of survival. Similar experiences from around the world have also demonstrated that more lives are saved if early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is combined with early defibrillation.


3.2: AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs):
Automated External Defibrillators (AED) are devices that deliver electrical shocks to shockable rhythms like Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), allowing the heart to restore its function. Automated External Defibrillator are defibrillators designed to be small in size, lightweight, and portable. They generally work on similar basic principles and do the following: 
(a)Analyze the electrical rhythm of the heart. 
(b)Determine whether the heart needs to be shocked. 
(c)If a shock is required, it automatically charges to a pre-set energy level. 
(d)If no shock is required, the device will not charge-up. Deliver electric shocks via attached Automated External Defibrillator pads. 
(e)Advise the rescuer through voice prompts on key actions to deliver the shock, check the casualty or continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). 
(f)Some AEDs provide counting tempo to assist rescuers in chest compressions. 


3.3: PREPARATION FOR AED USE The rescuer must first ascertain that the scene is safe for use of an Automated External Defibrillator. Avoid the following: 
Metallic surface - Remove casualty from contact with metal surfaces. These can conduct electric currents to the rescuer. 
Water - Sweat and moisture are good conductors of electricity and pose danger to the rescuer. It also reduces the adhesion of pads to the chest wall. If the chest is wet, wipe dry quickly with a towel. 
Gas - Flammable gases and oxygen sources are fire hazards. Move the casualty away from these before applying Automated External Defibrillator.
Steps in chest preparation and applying the Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads: 
(1) Expose the chest of the casualty to facilitate application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads. If needed, cut away the clothing. 
(2) If chest hair prevents proper electrode pad placement, shave the hair from these sites promptly. Automated External Defibrillator come with a shaver blade to expedite this. 
(3) Metallic objects such as necklace and chains should be moved away from the pads. These may result in sparks and potential burns to the chest wall. 
(4) For casualties with a pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator on the right, apply the pads at least four fingers’ breadth away from these devices. 
(5) Medication patches or monitoring electrodes on the chest wall should be removed as they may interfere with electrode pads placement. 
(6) Wipe dry a wet or sweaty chest to ensure proper adhesion of the electrode pads to the chest. Application of Automated External Defibrillator electrode pads to the chest wall must be done quickly with minimal interruptions to chest compressions.


3.4: PLACEMENT OF Automated External Defibrillator (AED) ELECTRODE PADS: Placement of Automated External Defibrillator Pads:
Right Pad: Place one pad on the right side of the chest, just below the right collar bone.
Left Pad: Place the other pad just below and to the left of the left nipple.
Steps for Applying Automated External Defibrillator Pads:
(1)Open the packet containing Automated External Defibrillator pads with cable and connector.
(2)Peel off the protective backing from the pads.
(3)Follow the pictures on the pads to determine their correct location on the chest.
(4)Press the pads firmly onto the chest wall.
(5)Stand clear when the Automated External Defibrillator is analyzing the heart rhythm.
(6)Stand clear when pressing the button to deliver the shock.
Key Note:
Minimize Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) interruption when placing Automated External Defibrillator pads and during defibrillation.


3.5: DEFIBRILLATION PROCEDURES 
1. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will initially analyse the heart’s electrical rhythm. It will give a voice prompt, such as “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” If you hear this, stop chest compressions. Do not touch the casualty and do not allow others to touch the casualty while the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is analysing. 
2. Spread your arms apart and say clearly “Stay Clear”. 
3. If the casualty has a shockable rhythm, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) machine will charge automatically. Charging takes a few seconds and may be indicated by a warning tone from the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). No one should touch the casualty during this brief charging phase.
4. Once the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is fully charged, it will prompt “PRESS THE SHOCK BUTTON NOW”. The rescuer then states clearly “Stay Clear”, ensures quickly that no one is touching the casualty, and then presses the shock button on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) firmly before releasing it. 
5. Once the shock is delivered, restart chest compressions. Continue the chest compressions until the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) repeats the voice prompt (every 2 minutes): “ANALYSING HEART RHYTHM. DO NOT TOUCH THE CASUALTY.” 
6. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts: “NO SHOCK ADVISED”, the lay rescuer should resume continuous chest compressions until the emergency medical team arrives to take over, or the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts the rescuer not to touch the casualty, or the casualty starts breathing normally. Healthcare providers who are trained and confident in pulse check should check the pulse when the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm every two minutes, or when breathing or movement is detected. Checking of pulse should not take more than ten seconds. If unsure of the presence of a pulse by the end of ten seconds, the rescuer should resume Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). If the pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing. 
7. Only stop Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) when: a. Paramedic takes over from rescuer; or b. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) prompts to analyse the casualty’s heart rhythm, is charging or when shock is to be delivered; or c. Casualty wakes up or regains normal breathing. 
8. Keep casualty in the same (supine) position and continue to monitor the casualty until help arrives. 
9. Throughout this period, the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) should remain connected to the casualty.


The flowchart below is titled "Algorithm for One-Rescuer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Use of Automated External Defibrillator (AED)" provides a step-by-step guide for performing Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). 
Here is a detailed step-by-step flow of the chart:

1. Check for Danger (D):
Ensure the area is safe for both the rescuer and the casualty.
2. Check Responsiveness (R):
Try to get a response from the casualty.
3. Shout for Help (S):
(a) Shout "Help!"
(b) Call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force Emergency Medical Services (SCDF EMS) and follow the dispatcher’s instructions or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest).
4. Get the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) (A):
If there is another person around, ask him/her to get the Automated External Defibrillator (AED).
If alone, do not leave the casualty.
5. Check for Normal Breathing and Pulse (B):
Look for the rise and fall of the chest (not more than 10 seconds).
If normal breathing (gasping is not normal breathing) is absent or unsure, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).
Healthcare Provider only: Check for carotid pulse as well.
6. Provide Continuous Chest Compressions (C):
Expose the chest adequately.
Perform chest compressions:
    Lower half of sternum
    Depth: 4-6 cm
    Rate: 100-120 per minute
    Allow complete chest recoil
Healthcare Provider only: After 30 chest compressions
    Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift
    Provide 2 ventilations via Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM)
    1 second per ventilation
    Tidal Volume 400-600 milliliters or chest rises
7. Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Arrives:
Check for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Hazards:
    Wet surfaces
    Metallic surfaces
    Flammable gases nearby
Continue Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)
Turn on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED)
Ensure the chest is bare and dry
Apply pads as printed on the Automated External Defibrillator


3.6: POST-INCIDENT PROCEDURES:
Hand-over to emergency services When paramedics take over the casualty, they may require a summary of the events that have occurred:
(a) Time of collapse (best estimate)
(b) Whether the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) was used How many shocks were given?
(c) Any previous medical history and medications, if known.
(d) If available, provide a document that lists these events.


Assist the paramedics: Until the casualty is loaded into the ambulance.
The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) electrode pads should remain on the casualty while transporting to the hospital.
What are the duties for the person in charge of the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) after the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) has been used?
The facility or safety manager must be informed of the usage of the Automated External Defibrillator (AED).


The person in charge of the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) has the following responsibilities:
For commercial establishments or workplaces, or the local community centre or management office for residential areas:
1. For Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) located in places other than Housing and Development Board (HDB) blocks, they should be returned to the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) owner (building management or security staff) after use.
2. Replace the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) consumables such as the electrode pads, shaver kit, towel, and gloves if used (replacement done by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) owner or Automated External Defibrillator (AED) vendor).
3. The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) battery must be checked. Contact the vendor of the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) device for advice on battery replacement.
4. If the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) was removed from a box with a key in a thin glass window, the glass may have been broken to retrieve the key. This glass piece would need to be replaced and the key placed back onto the holder. (Replaced by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) vendor). 
5. Most Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) have a chip that records the resuscitation sequence. Get the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) vendor to print the record from this chip. It is useful for audit and quality assurance purposes. 
6. Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) are almost maintenance-free. 
7. The battery indicator on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) needs to be checked annually (or as advised by the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) vendor) to ensure that it is still functional. Once it gives a low-battery display, steps to replace the battery promptly should be undertaken.


For Public Access Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) from Housing Development Board (HDB):
1. Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) Ambulance crew will convey the casualty to the hospital along with the public access Automated External Defibrillator (AED). The used Automated External Defibrillator (AED) will be collected by the contracted vendor at the respective fire stations. The vendor will restock and replace the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) back to its original location.
2. Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) are almost maintenance-free.
3. The battery indicator on the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) needs to be checked periodically to ensure that it is still functional. Once it gives a low-battery display, steps to replace the battery promptly should be undertaken (facilitated by Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF)/Housing Development Board (HDB)).


RETRIEVAL OF AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATOR:
Public access Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) in Singapore are typically secured in a locked box with a break glass mechanism. The glass must be broken to retrieve the key and to unlock the box. 
During emergencies, members of the public responding to potential cardiac arrest cases have been reported to have suffered injuries while retrieving Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs), such as by being cut by glass while breaking the pane of glass or while trying to retrieve the key.
A recent survey of cardiac arrest responders who retrieved Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) conducted locally highlighted that a pattern of injuries exists.


The following are recommendations for retrieval of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs): 
1. Download the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) myResponder application! (See Chapter 1.8) Responders with the app have a much better chance to find the nearest defibrillator with the help of the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) map. 
2. To safely retrieve the Automated External Defibrillator (AED): 
    a. Do not use your bare hands/elbows to break the glass – most injuries from retrieving occur with breaking the glass. Use personal items instead e.g. mobile phone, shoes, keys etc. to reduce the risk of injuries sustained. 
    b. Clear all glass fragments around the edges with the object used to break the glass before retrieving the key. Another common mechanism of injury is due to lacerations when reaching for the key inside.


SAMPLE PRACTICAL SCENARIOS (FOR ADULTS): 
The following scenarios may be used by the instructor to depict possible situations which you may encounter due to the varied nature of an emergency. By practicing these scenarios, you can be more confident to assist a casualty in emergencies. 
(1) Shock – No Shock – No Shock 
(2) No Shock – Shock – No Shock 
(3) Shock – Shock – No Shock 
(4) No Shock – No Shock – Shock 
(5) No Shock – No Shock – No Shock


5.4: HEIMLICH MAN OEUVRE 
Step 1: Assessment  
- Ask: “Are you choking?” . If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.  
Note: 
- If the casualty is able to cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough , perform the Heimlich Manoeuvre.  

Step 2: Position of rescuer  
- If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty.  
- If the casualty is sitting,the rescuer kneels and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.   

Step 3: Locate the  landmark  
- Put your arms around the casualty’s abdomen.  
- Locate the navel.  
- Place 2 fingers above the navel  (see figure 5 -5) and well below the tip of xiphoid process. 
- Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm.  
- Place the thumb side of the fist against the casualty’s abdomen in the midline and just above the 2 fingers’ spacing.
 
 
Step 4: Heimlich Manoeuvre  
- Lean the casualty forward with one hand, while maintaining the fist against the abdomen. 
- Grasp your fist with your other hand.  
- Give quick inward and upward abdominal thrusts in one motion into the casualty’s abdomen.  
- Deliver each abdominal thrust firmly  and distinctly with the intent of relieving the obstruction . Perform continuous abdominal thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.   
Note:  
- Usually, this procedure will force the foreign object out of the throat and the airway obstruction will be relieved.  
 

The Self-Administered Heimlich Manoeuvre  
- To treat one’s own complete FBAO, the casualty makes a fist with one hand, places the thumb-side on the abdomen above the navel (2 fingers’ breadth) and below the xiphoid process, grasps the fist with the other, and then presses inward and upward toward the diaphragm with a quick motion.  
- If unsuccessful, the casualty can also press the upper abdomen over any firm surface such as the back of a chair, side of a table or porch railing. Several abdominal thrusts may be needed to clear the airway.  
 

5.5: CHEST THRUSTS  
This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.  
Step 1: Assessment  
- Ask: “Are you choking?” If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.  

Step 2: Position of rescuer  
- If the casualty is standing, the rescuer stands behind the casualty. 
- If the casualty is sitting, the rescuer kneels  and positions himself/herself behind the casualty.  

Step 3: Location of landmark  
- Place your arms under the casualty’s armpits encircling the chest. 
- Make a fist with one hand with the thumb in the palm.  
- Place thumb-side of fist on the middle of the casualty’s sternum (breastbone). 

Step 4: Chest thrusts  
- Grasp your fist with your other hand and bring yourself close to the casualty before giving quick backward thrusts . 
- Deliver each backward thrust firmly and distinctly. Perform  continuous backward chest thrusts with the intent of relieving the obstruction until the foreign body is expelled or the casualty becomes unconscious.  
 

5.6: RELIEF OF UNCONSCIOUS ADULT/CHILD  FBAO  
If the casualty becomes unconscious, proceed with the following steps. 
Step 1: Position the casualty  
- Support and position the casualty lying on his/her back on a firm flat surface . 
Step 2: Activate the Emergency Medical Service (EMS)  
- Rescuer shouts: “Help! Call ambulance 995  and get an AED !” However, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED.  
Step 3: Start 30 chest compressions  
Locate the landmark and perform 30 chest compressions using the same location and techniques used for chest compressions in CPR. (Refer to Adult CPR, page 17 to 26; or Child CPR, page 48 to 53)  


Step 4: Open the airway 
- Perform the Head-Tilt, Chin-lift manoeuvre  to open the airway.  
- While maintaining head tilt, open the mouth gently to check for visible foreign  bodies.  
- If no foreign body is seen, perform another 30 chest compressions. 
- If a foreign body  is seen, maintain the open airway with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre and insert the index finger of your other hand into the casualty’s mouth along the inside of the cheek. 
- Use a hooking action to dislodge the foreign body and manoeuvre it out of the mouth. Take care not to force the foreign body deeper into the throat. This manoeuvre is known as the finger sweep . 
Note:  
- Do not perform blind finger sweep. Blind finger sweep may push the object back or further into the airway.  
- However, if there are no objects found in the mouth, repeat steps 3 and 4 until object has been removed.  
- For lay rescuers – Once object has been removed, check for breathing. If breathing is absent, repeat steps 3 and 4 until breathing resumes or emergency help arrives.  For trained healthcare providers – See step 5. 


For Trained Healthcare Providers: 
Step 5: Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation  
- Attempt one v entilation via BVM (1st ventilation). If BVM is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations.   
- Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective. 
- Pinch the casualty’s nose with your index finger and thumb; and seal your lips around the casualty’s mouth.  
- Provide 1 breath by b lowing steadily into the casualty’s  mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise.   
- Release the nose after each breath.  
- If there is no resistance, airway is clear. Check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start CPR.  
- If there is resistance (i.e., the chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the casualty’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre, and re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation).  
- Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving.  
- Check for normal breathing and pulse.  
- If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start CPR. 
- If pulse is definitely present but the casualty is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (one breath every 5 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand, 4-a-thousand, 5-a-thousand . For children, perform rescue breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute for 2 minutes (one breath every 3 seconds) by giving one breath and counting 2-a-thousand, 3-a-thousand . Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 12 breaths  (for adult) or 20 breaths (for child) . Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse.  
- If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.  

Note:  
1. For healthcare providers, provide ventilations via a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If there is no BVM available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations for any reason, check for normal breathing and pulse for not more than 10 seconds.  
2. If no BVM is available and you are unable or unwilling to do mouth-to-mouth ventilations, perform continuous chest compressions. If you are a single rescuer and feeling tired, you m ay take a rest of not more than 10 seconds (preferably after 100 compressions). (Refer to Adult CPR, page 17 to 26; or Child CPR, page 48 to 53 ) 


6.1: INFANT CPR  
 
This module addresses the care of infants  with cardiac arrest, up to 1 year of age.  
Infants rarely collapse (goes into cardiac arrest) owing to a primary heart problem. Cardiac arrest is usually secondary to other events, such as respiratory illness or major trauma. Therefore, rescuers must detect and promptly treat early signs of respiratory and circulatory failure to prevent cardiac arrest.  

(D) Check for Danger  
Ensure that the rescuer operates in a safe environment. Resuscitation should start where the infant is found, unless the site is unsafe or unconducive (eg. roads which are still open to traffic, burning building, etc), then the infant should be removed to a safe, flat and open space as soon as possible.  
 
(R) Check for Responsiveness  
- The rescuer should tap the infant’s shoulders and the sole of the feet and ask loudly: ‘Hello! Hello! Are you OK?’.
- Avoid violent shaking of the infant as this may result in injury.   
- Avoid unnecessary movements of the neck to prevent injuries to the head and neck.  
 

For CPR to be effective, the infant must be lying on his/her back on a firm, flat surface. If the infant  is lying face down (prone position), or on his/her side, rescuer will need to roll the infant over onto his/her back.   
(S) Shout to get help  
If the infant is unresponsive, shout to get help from bystanders to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS or activate the emergency response system (for in-facility/in-hospital cardiac arrest). If alone, use a handphone to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force and put on speaker phone mode. An Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher can help a lay rescuer recognise cardiac arrest, and once this is established, the dispatcher will guide the rescuer to begin CPR by providing instructions on how to perform Chest Compressions via a handphone.  
- In a situation where a lone rescuer found an unresponsive infant in a remote area with no accessibility to activate emergency medical service, it is necessary for the lone rescuer to assess the infant’s responsiveness and breathing. If normal breathing is absent, CPR (chest compressions and ventilations) should commence immediately and continued for at least two minutes before leaving the infant to seek nearby assistance or obtain phone access and return to the infant immediately to continue CPR. However, in the process, if there is another person around, ask him/her to call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force EMS and get an AED. 
 
(A) Ask someone to get an AED 
- Ask someone to get an AED if there is one within a 60-second walking distance. The Singapore Civil Defence Force emergency medical dispatcher may be able to locate the nearest AED and summon help from CPR-trained rescuers in the vicinity. However, if you are the lone rescuer, do not leave the casualty. 

(B) Check for normal Breathing  
- Look for the rise and fall of the chest 
- Do not take more than 10 seconds.  
- It is important to recognize that gasping is NOT normal breathing but a sign of cardiac arrest. Start chest compressions immediately if you unsure whether the casualty has abnormal breathing or gasping. 
 

For trained healthcare providers only  
- Locate the brachial pulse (inner aspect of the upper arm, between the infant’s elbow and shoulder) with the index and middle fingers.  
- Apply gentle pressure and feel for the pulse at the same time as checking for normal breathing . 
- Checking for normal breathing and pulse should not take more than 10 seconds.  
- If unsure about the presence of pulse and normal breathing  at the end of 10 seconds, assume cardiac arrest and commence chest compressions.  


(C) Chest Compressions  
- Site of chest compression should be at the centre of the chest at the lower half of the sternum (breastbone). Ensure adequate exposure of the chest.  Locate the correct hand position for chest compressions:  
    - Use your index finger to d raw an imaginary line 
    between the nipples  to the centre of the sternum.  

    - Place your middle (third), and ring (fourth) fingers next 
    to your index finger on the center of 
    the infant’s chest.  
    
    - Lift up your index finger but maintain the middle and 
    ring fingers on the sternum and commence chest 
    compressions  using the pulp of the fingers. 
 
    - Depth of chest compression for infants must be 1/3 the anterior-posterior diameter of the infant’s chest (about 3 to 4 cm). 
    - The compression rate is 100–120 per minute.  
    - Ensure complete recoil of the chest wall after each compression.
