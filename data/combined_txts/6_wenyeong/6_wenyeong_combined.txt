INTRODUCTION: 
 Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. Choking in an infant occurs most commonly during eating or playing. 
In a witnessed choking event, the chances of survival will increase if the rescuer is able to intervene when the infant is still conscious. The obstructed airway of a conscious infant can be cleared using back blows and chest thrusts. 
Precautions:
 -Do not “force-feed” milk. Allow rest in between. 
-Check the teat of the milk bottle prior to feeding. The size may be too large for the infant. 
 -Cut food into very small pieces and feed the infant (if on a weaning diet) small spoonful each time.
 -Discourage moving about (crawling) or playing while eating. 
 RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN BODY AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (FBAO) 
Choking develops very abruptly and is associated with coughing, gagging or stridor (a high pitched, inspiratory noisy sound). 
If the infant has an infection (e.g. fever, nasal congestion, voice hoarseness), suspect epiglottitis and croup. 
Bring the infant immediately to a hospital as the back blows and chest thrusts technique may not relieve the airway obstruction.

Assess severity Mild Partial Airway Obstruction (PAO) (Able to produce sound, breathe or cough). Do not interfere* Allow the casualty to clear airway by coughing. Continue to check for deterioration (inability to produce sound, breathe or cough) or until obstruction is relieved. Consider calling 995 for SCDF EMS (Emergency Medical Services) if repeated attempts by casualty are not successful *Avoid feeding the casualty water/food and do not shake the casualty in a attempt to dislodge the foreign body. 
Severe Complete Airway Obstruction (CAO) (Unable to produce sound, breathe or cough). Conscious 5 back blows and 5 chest thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or casualty becomes unconscious. 
Unconscious Place casualty in a supine position on a flat and firm surface. Call 995 for SCDF EMS and get an AED (Automated External Defibrillator) if visible and nearby. 
Start 30 chest compressions.'

Step 1: Assessment 
Infant is conscious and has stridor.
If the obstruction is getting worse (complete airway obstruction), you will notice at least one of the following: 
-Loss of voice. 
-Increased breathing difficulty. 
-The infant’s face may turn blue. 
Immediately attempt to relieve the airway obstruction. 
Step 2: Back blows and chest thrusts technique 
Slide your arm under the infant to support the head with your palm and the back with your forearm. 
Support the head and back of the infant’s body 
“Sandwich” the infant: 
o With your other hand, support infant’s jaw with your thumb on one side and the rest of your fingers on the other side. 
Place your forearm on the infant’s chest.

Support the infant’s head and body as a unit. 
- Stride one leg forward (same side as the forearm supporting the infant) by bending the knee. Ensure that the foot is flat on the floor. Do not tip-toe. 
 -Straddle the infant facing downwards with the head lower than the body. 
 -Rest the forearm that is supporting infant’s chest) onto the thigh (same side as the hand, making sure that the infant’s head is lower than the body. 
Deliver 5 back blows forcefully between the shoulder blades with the heel of your other hand. 
“Sandwich” the infant and turn the infant over with head lower than the body. 
Rest the forearm that is supporting the infant’s back onto the thigh (same side as the hand) to support the infant. 
- Draw an imaginary line between infant’s nipples with the ring (fourth) finger to the centre of the chest. 
Place your middle and index fingers (third and second) next to your ring (fourth) finger.'

- Lift up your ring (fourth) finger and deliver 5 chest thrusts over the lower half of the sternum (breastbone).
- If a foreign body is seen, place the infant on a firm flat surface and remove the foreign body with your little finger.
- Repeat back blows and chest thrusts until the foreign body is expelled or the infant becomes unconscious. Figure 7-7 – Deliver 5 chest thrusts. Note: 

Note:  
- Do not tip-toe when performing back blows and chest thrusts as the rescuer may lose balance and fall.
- Each back blow and chest thrust should be delivered with sufficient force and with the intention of expelling the foreign body.






- If foreign body is seen, maintain open airway with Chin-Lift and insert the little finger of your other hand into the infant’s mouth along the inside of the cheek.
- Use a hooking action to dislodge the foreign body and manoeuvre it out of the mouth. Take care not to force the foreign body deeper into the throat. This manoeuvre is known as the finger sweep.

Note:
- Do not perform blind finger sweep. Blind finger sweep may push the object back or further into the airway.
- However, if there are no objects found in the mouth, repeat steps 3 and 4 until object has been removed.
- For lay rescuers – Once object has been removed, check for breathing. If breathing is absent, repeat steps 3 and 4 until breathing resumes or emergency help arrives. For trained healthcare providers – See step 5.

For Trained Healthcare Provider:
Step 5: Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) ventilation
- Attempt one ventilation via Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) (1st ventilation). If Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) is not available and you are willing and trained, you may provide mouth-to-nose-and-mouth ventilations.
    - Perform a Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. An open airway will ensure ventilations are effective.


    - Seal your lips around the casualty’s nose and mouth. 
    - Provide 1 breath by blowing steadily into the infant’s mouth for about 1 second per breath, sufficient to make the chest visibly rise. Figure 7-16 – Mouth-to-mouth-and-nose ventilation 
- If there is no resistance (chest rises), airway is clear. Proceed to check for normal breathing and pulse. If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within 10 seconds, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). 
- If there is resistance (chest does not rise), the airway may be blocked. Reposition the infant’s head with the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift manoeuvre. Re-attempt to ventilate (2nd ventilation). 
- Repeat steps 3 to 5 until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking, or moving. 
- Check for normal breathing and pulse. 
- If normal breathing or pulse are absent or you are unsure, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). 
- If pulse is definitely present but the infant is not breathing, perform rescue breathing at 30 breaths per minute (one breath every 2 seconds) by giving one breath and count “2-a-thousand”. Repeat the sequence until you have completed a total of 30 breaths. Re-assess for normal breathing and pulse. 
- If both the breathing and pulse are present, monitor the casualty till help arrives.


Flow chart showing the summary of Unconscious Infant Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) Relief for Healthcare Providers:

1. Safely position the unconscious casualty on a flat and firm surface.

2. Shout for Help:
   - Shout "Help!" and call 995 for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), following the dispatcher’s instructions.

3. Perform 30 chest compressions.

4. Check for Foreign Body (FB):
   - If Foreign Body (FB) is seen:
     - Open the mouth using Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift (HTCL) and check for a foreign body.
     - Remove with a finger sweep.
     - Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift (HTCL) and provide 1 ventilation.
       - If chest rises:
         - Check for normal breathing and pulse (not more than 10 seconds).
           - If pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.
           - If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within ten seconds, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).
       - If chest does not rise:
         - Re-attempt Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift (HTCL) and provide 1 ventilation again.
           - If chest rises: Follow the same steps as above.
           - If chest does not rise: Continue the cycle of chest compressions and rechecking for Foreign Body (FB).

   - If no Foreign Body (FB) is seen:
     - Check for normal breathing and pulse (not more than 10 seconds).
       - If pulse is present but not breathing, start rescue breathing.
       - If unsure of the presence of normal breathing and pulse within ten seconds, start Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).

Note: 
   - HTCL stands for Head-Tilt-Chin-Lift.
